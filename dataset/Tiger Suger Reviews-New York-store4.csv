5 stars,"This Tiger Sugar is a small store that shares its space with Chunky Boss. Inside the store there are only few stools to sit and dine. The menu has most of the popular TS drinks including the famous brown sugar tea. We ordered multiple drinks. It was prepared within a short time. Quick and friendly service. Loved the taste of their drinks.

This is the first I was in a TS store that had bakery items. I got a couple of egg tars and puffs. Both items were amazing quality. Egg tars had such delicious yolk. The puff had tasty cream in the middle. I was so impressed with their bakery goods."
2 stars,"Tiger Sugar with a bakery section and hot fried chicken (they were out of salt pepper chicken, though). Bubble tea was ok, though the tea was very bitter at 50% sugar one time, and the next time was good, so rather inconsistent? Puffs were good, filled when you order them.

Fried chicken cutlet was good, but there was a large wishbone or similar on one side, had to spit out what I was eating and ended up almost piercing my tongue with a piece of shattered chicken bone. Not good.

Service on the slower end, so have patience."
5 stars,"The Tiger Sugar branch with most items I think. The girl who works today is super super nice, with such an angel voice! She asked be a lot of thoughtful questions. This is not my first time come to boba shop, but this one gives me good impression that makes me want to come back againðŸ˜†!

I ordered the classic combo, which is the number one. I also ordered the eclair and puffs. They are not as sweet as I thought, which is wonderful, instead, itâ€™s a bit creamy. Very nice! I also ordered on more #7, which is what I always order. Itâ€™s sooo good!"
5 stars,"I tried Tiger Sugar's new pastries, and they were really fresh and crispy. I especially liked the strawberry egg tart and croissants, though the croissants were quite smallâ€”they looked more like mini croissants. Iâ€™d recommend going for the egg tarts and cream puffs instead. The place is on the smaller side, but the brown sugar boba was as good as always!"
1 star,"This specific drink is so bitter when I was drinking it which is so different from the ones that I had when I was in Brooklyn. In addition, you can see thereâ€™s some sort of unknown substances in there. And I had a upset stomach."
4 stars,"Stopped into this shop and ordered two boba teas,  the Brave As A Tiger, and the Passion Friuty Green Tea with Boba & Jelly. They were both delicious! ðŸ˜‹
Just remember to shake up your drink before putting your straw in and drinking!!

We didn't order any food,  just the teas. The prices are reasonable at $7 for a medium."
1 star,"i was drinking my strawberry mochi boba & i felt something strange on my tongue, pulled out someones gel nail polish form ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤® this is disgusting and unacceptable, be careful where you buy your drinks â€¦"
5 stars,"Delicious pastries. Egg tart is amazing and the cream puffs â€¦ we tried the chocolate and the vanilla â€¦ going back for more and to try strawberry!  Crispy shells, rich fillings - must try!"
5 stars,They didnâ€™t have only bubble tea they also come with more option like deep fried chickens or cream puff
5 stars,"The number1 signature on the menu was really nice and tasty.. the staff was very friendly and accomodating too

One of the best taiwanese boba tea i had so far"
4 stars,"This tiger sugar is consistent with all the ones I have been too.  This location also serves chunky boss.

If you want bubble tea then you can use the self ordering kiosk by the windows. You don't have to go inside.  Go inside if you want to order both products.

There is seating inside but with how small it is , the space gets cluttered up with people waiting for their orders."
5 stars,"We were staying in the club quarters hotel  It's in front of our  hotel, I ordered the tiger sugar and signature eclair, then I bought black sugar milk egg roll it was  buy 1 get 1 free, omg Itâ€™s so yummy I wish I can buy more. Please can you help me where I can order online and ship to me here in NC I need 3 -4 dozen  of black sugar milk egg roll please"
2 stars,"I ordered the chicken cutlet with fries .
Pros: The fries were really good , perfectly fired with a good crunch .
Cons: (personally) The chicken cutlet was entirely too sweet and the breading was soggy. Not exactly what I was expecting."
5 stars,"My employer and I decided to visit 45th street during our eventful break. I saw Tiger Sugar and decided to try out its food and bubble tea. After ordering, I enjoyed the Plum Sweet Potato Fries. Based on the strong aroma of the side order of fries, my gut knew that I am eating food made from natural, starch ingredients with a hint of sugar. I also ordered Taro Bubble Tea."
1 star,"Donâ€™t order their mango pomelo/sago, it tastes like the mixture of chemical and plastic. I am not sure if itâ€™s because the bad quality of cup or straw so that I even poured it out in a glass cup, it still tasted the same. Not gonna lie, the tasting of that drink is really disgusting, and I even tips them."
4 stars,I love the brown sugar bubble tea! Unfortunately the latest strawberry crush is NOT it. Tastes yogurty which doesn't mesh well with the brown sugar
5 stars,"In addition to its milk tea, the bread from Tiger Sugar is also extremely delicious. It's a brand that puts a lot of effort into making its products."
4 stars,"We had the brown sugar milk, it was tasty with little pearls (i think it was sago?) and black tapioca pearls."
5 stars,"I think I had heard of Tiger Sugar before, but I never really tried it. So after discovering the Midtown Comics that is right next door, I decided to give this place a try as a semi-regular bubble tea enthusiast.

This Tiger Sugar near Grand Central appears to be a brand new location as there is a grand opening sign that advertises a special offer outside. The whole menu and their specialty seems to be brown sugar boba milk tea made with fresh milk, as well as other options having slight variations such as different toppings. For example, I ordered number 10, which is a brown sugar boba tea with chocolate chips and cream mousse.

Maybe it was because I was the only customer there when I arrived, but my drink arrived literally seconds after I paid for my order. Cashier seemed as chill as the tea itself, which for my first time at this boba venue was pretty decent. All the drinks cost at least $6.25 though, so if you're already a fan of boba and are wary with your funds, your mileage may vary. You can't use your credit card unless you spend at least $10, so I recommend buying some tea for a friend as well if you don't have cash on hand.

Hope this new area does well, tea was nice enough to maybe consider coming again if I happen to be in the area."
5 stars,"2/2024: As good as any other tiger sugar out there, and theyâ€™re good. $6.50 for a drink. Nice chewy boba milk tea here."
1 star,"First and last time. The gentleman working here needs a customer service lesson. He was too busy rushing us because he needed to fulfill the door dash orders. News flash my friend, the customers coming into the store takes first priority. Will not return. Gong Cha treats ppl better and they listen to the customer."
4 stars,"Nice location. If you google map it, it will show a picture of CoCo, but itâ€™s actually Tiger Sugar. Small place inside and there is seating. Itâ€™s about $7 a drink after tax. Self order and pay at kiosk."
5 stars,Tiger sugar has the best bubble tea! The brown sugar and cream is to die for. Always velvety and delicious.
2 stars,"A few years ago when this chain was trendy their signature black sugar tea was incredible.

First time trying it in a few years and everything that was right before is wrong now. Taste and texture were bland. Boba was good but they use a blend with mini boba I donâ€™t care for."
5 stars,"Love the classic milk tea! The hot option in the winter is super nice, it's one of my favourite things to warm up with!"
5 stars,"Excellent service. Fastest bubble tea making I've seen in some time, and extremely friendly service."
4 stars,"Service was pretty quick ( there's a flipside to that), the place was clean and the customer section was small w/ 2 chairs/stools and a counter that runs along the wall. There's a huge chicken nugget on the wall opposite the entrance.

I bought the brown sugar Boba tea w/ pudding and boba. Tastes great, no complaints. Was my first time getting milk tea with milk pudding so I'm glad it was good. The milk tea added texture- soft and smooth whereas the boba is soft and gummy- more than anything else.

My friend bought the taro milk tea w/ pudding- and it was bad. She tried to like it. I tried to like it (and Taro milk tea is both of our favorite drinks to get w/ boba). It just wasn't good. The pudding was fine I guess, it was just seemed to be the only Taro thing about the drink. The tea itself was light tan and opaque/milky. It needed flavor and sugar, and even the tasty boba couldn't help it. The worst thing was that there was something grainy in the drink. At first I assumed it was simply large granules of sugar, but then I actually came across those. Then I guessed it must've been undissolved Taro powder or something, which didn't help regardless. Having worked in a store that mostly slings beverages I totally understand the need for speed, but not at the cost of quality. I noticed they may have been getting mobile orders and only saw one guy making drinks so maybe he was feeling the pressure, but making sure any ingredient that can be dissolved is 90-100% dissolved can really improve the customer experience, especially when the drinking experience is just as based on texture as flavor.

We would've gone back to swap the drink, but like I said- she tried to like it and give it a shot, and we were heading to an appointment.

Overall I would go back, I'd just never get a Taro tea here again."
1 star,"When we got our drinks, we asked if they could put some milk in it. To which they rudely said not to. After we kindly asked for a refund or if we could just change our drink they said no  throw it away. Not only did we have a bad experience the boba was not even good. That is why this place get 1/5 stars"
5 stars,"I absolutely love this store, perfect location, the staff was extremely nice and the drink I picked out was amazing! Love the way they make their tapioca, theyâ€™re huge, super soft and chewy with a great flavor! Iâ€™m not going to give less than 5 stars because of the service and quality but my only tiny issue is that thereâ€™s a $10 minimum purchase with a card. If they could fix this tiny issue Iâ€™d be the happiest. Iâ€™ll be returning almost daily for sure!"
1 star,Absolute worst boba Iâ€™ve ever tasted. Ordered the brown sugar and it was a straight up thick cup of cream with mushy boba that all gooped together. Also got a matcha tea boba which was better but still not great. Would not recommend. Couldnâ€™t take more than a few sips of the brown sugar before I had to throw it away. If youâ€™re lactose intolerant be warned
5 stars,"Excellent customer service, the staff was welcoming and super friendly! They didnâ€™t rush me, allowed me to take my time to decide my order. The boba and chicken were delicious!"
5 stars,Chocolate boba + pearl + jelly less sweet. What a perfect combination.
5 stars,Excellent service. I had mistakenly placed an order to another store location but the manager at this store was amazing and made me my order again. Not to mention that their boba is amazing (softest boba in town). Would totally recommend!
5 stars,"I got the signature drink and it was SO GOOD. Not overly sweet like most boba (and particularly brown sugar boba drinks) are. Staff could not have been more friendly, and the place was very clear."
4 stars,"Pretty good. Not the boba tea you'd normally expect, but still amazing!"
5 stars,"Good service,the food is amazing"
1 star,Worst tasting boba I've had. Just tasted like milk.
5 stars,Super nice and understanding. I am definitely coming back here!
4 stars,Nice shop- Their tea is super sweet at baseline and would recommend doing the slightly less sugar. Their tea flavored popcorn is a great treat too!
4 stars,Affordable.The boba was really good. I came twice while I was in Manhattan. Though the second time I went they had run out of tapioca the girls in the kitchen offered a bunch of substitutes.
4 stars,"First time at this spot for the Chunky Boss (Chicken) and it was everything they advertised and more. The chicken alone was hung and enough for a meal on its own, It was savory with a slight sweat underline heat but not spicy.... I got the original.
Can't wait to go back to try the other menu items."

1 star,I order grab yesterday they forgot to put straw inside
3 stars,"I tried the jumbo Boba, turns out it is just a jello ball. The jello fell apart in my mouth and it was just a weird texture for the jumbo Boba."

5 stars,"I ordered a glass of milk and a piece of fried chicken. After getting the Zhen milk, I took a sip (mm...). The perfect combination of QQ pearls and milk made the Zhen milk extremely delicious. The fried chicken is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside plus hot and sour powder, making the fried chicken rich in layers. Very delicious!
