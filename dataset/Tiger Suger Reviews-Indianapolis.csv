5 stars,"Tiger sugar is the epitome of a welcoming environment. The workers and owner have a generous spirit in customer service. I love the boba, croffles, and tayaki from here! Recommended going here with friends and family!"
5 stars,"If you are in or near Greenwood, IN looking for delicious boba teas or milks and incredible desserts then this is a must stop. The ambiance is very warm and welcoming with plenty of seating to include lounge and couches. Owners and staff are very friendly. There is something here for everyone."
3 stars,"A friend of mine had a negative experience here but I wanted to experience it firsthand and give this place a try. I liked the interior and ambiance. Service was okay. Bathrooms were clean. The teas I ordered were Thai and Classic Taro. Personally, the brown sugar overpowered the flavor because it was absent of one. Short answer is: my friend was right!"
5 stars,I never give reviews but i wanted to let yall know the guy working there was super friendly and kind! He made us feel welcomed and the drinks were delicious as well! I had the matcha & my boyfriend got their signature drink & the kiddo got a mango slush and we all LOVED our drinks. The place was also very clean & cozy!
1 star,"WOW, this place is slow and so expensive and imho, not worth the wait or the price. I took my son here 2 days ago, and there was a bunch of people sitting waiting for their drinks(I wish I would have noticed that)! We ordered 2 teas at 12:46PM I received my receipt via SMS. Then we waited...During our wait, the gentlemen that took our order, called out numbers for people waiting only to ask them what they wanted to substitute as they were out of something that went in their drink(this happened twice). Then when it was his turn to make my sons tea, he said, sorry but we are out of passionfruit Boba. What would you like to substitute it with?

So finally at 1:17 he called our number and we got our drinks. I got the peach tea, with popping peach BOBA, and honestly as if the wait wasn't long enough, the tea was horrible. I was so disappointed! My son told me he would rather go to the mall and get one there next time, so I guess that is what we will do.

I would avoid this place at all costs, at least until they have their staffing and ordering of products straight. Just my 2¬¢"
5 stars,"Very delicious, I‚Äôve always heard of this because it‚Äôs so popular in Asia and New York and other bigger cities. I‚Äôm so glad we have one here! By looking at it you would think it‚Äôs super sweet, but it‚Äôs actually not at all. Creamy and just right amount of sugar, it has a very nice black roast flavor. I would recommend this to everyone."
5 stars,"I ‚Äúneed‚Äù and ‚Äúwant‚Äù to try other menu items (especially a ‚Äúcroffle‚Äù)  but I just love the Mango Sago SO much!  üòÇ

LOVE the ambience and staff!

Give ‚Äòem a try!"
5 stars,"From the food to the place, everything is so well done. The customer service was amazing with their greetings as soon as you come in. The decorations make me feel comfortable and welcoming with the woodsy feeling. Variety of boba and croffles to choose from, but everything has been tasty!!"
5 stars,tiger sugar is one of the best places to take pics with my friends. i just come when i want to relax and chill. the workers are always friendly and nice to chat with. definitely would recommend!!!
5 stars,"Been there twice so far and plan on coming back!

I love that the drinks are a little less on the sweet side than most boba shops. Good texture boba"
5 stars,"Highly reccomend stopping in and trying this place. The decorations inside felt very sterile. Very simple but clean. The drinks are def the star of the show. I tried a mango slush, which had real mango in the bottom. I love mango and this was very tasty. My wife ordered the number 1. This was a different level. It had boba pearls and milk pearls and the drink flavor was excellent. Fantastic carmel and brown sugar flavors with coffee tones too. Can't wait to try more on the menu."
5 stars,We've been here a few times now and all of the staff are so friendly and welcoming! The bobas are tasty and the snacks are yummy! Highly recommend!

5 stars,"The best place for boba and drinks...coming back again for sure
service was good and owner is very friendly and aproachable"
1 star,60% ice. Too much ice and not much drink. Also the XL size drink is $1 more on Doordash even if you choose pickup in store.
5 stars,"They had a very good customer service, which all the workers were really nice. The service was quick and it was still one of the best drinks. The ambience and atmosphere were really beautiful. Fully recommended. P.S one of the cleanest bathrooms you‚Äôll see."
5 stars,"Absolutely delicious!!! I'm new to this Boba thing,  but this place is great!!"
5 stars,I love their boba. The drinks are very delicious and way better than other boba places. I am glad we have Tiger Sugar in Indianapolis.
5 stars,Awesome new find in south-side Indianapolis. Just north of greenwood mall. Decor inside matches perfectly to the delightful teas. They have a wide variety of drinks to choose from.
3 stars,"I got the matcha drink
Pros:
I enjoyed the taste of the matcha! It didn‚Äôt have a grassy taste + the interior was pretty
Con:
-I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the tapioca boba
-The size of the cups were misleading because their L was basically a standard size (medium/regular)"
5 stars,"Excellent customer service. Drinks are amazing & delicious.. highly recommend.
I finally found where to get my favorite boba drinks.."
1 star,"Although the service and atmosphere was good, the boba did not taste good for the price. I feel as though you can get a better boba somewhere else for the same price."
2 stars,The owner was trash talking another local teahouse IN FRONT of their employees just to promote his own business. I believe that your products should be able to stand on their own legs if they're truly good. It left a sour taste in my mouth.
5 stars,Love all they have to offer. They have board games and great music. Perfect for small hangout or date. Wish more people knew about this place.
1 star,The boba didn‚Äôt taste good at all and workers there were really outgoing and greedy. Overall this was not a good boba shop to go to
