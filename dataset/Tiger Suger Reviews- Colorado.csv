5 stars,"Best boba in Colorado hands down.

We got a lychee boba and their number 1 black sugar boba. It was excellent. We got XL you have to go with XL.

Perfect sweetness, the owner was amazing. Took the time to explain and made sure we ordered what we wanted and recommended perfectly she was also amazingly friendly! :))

Every time I am in Westminster, I will stop by to get my boba fix.

Thank you üôè"
5 stars,"Tiger Sugar‚Äôs boba teas are very different from your regular boba. It‚Äôs definitely more innovative, rich and delicious. It also has yummy snacks like the fish balls. Highly recommend!"
5 stars,"Absolutely amazing bubble tea! TIGER SUGAR never disappoints. Their signature brown sugar boba is next level‚Äîrich, creamy, and perfectly balanced in sweetness. The boba pearls are soft, chewy, and infused with that delicious caramelized flavor. You can tell they use high-quality ingredients, and the presentation is always beautiful with that signature tiger stripe effect!

The staff is super friendly and efficient, even when there's a long line (which is totally worth the wait!). If you're a bubble tea lover, this place is a must-try. Highly recommend the Brown Sugar Boba Milk with Cream Mousse‚Äîit's a game changer! Will definitely be coming back for more! üßã"
5 stars,"Great taste! So glad that there‚Äôs an affordable proper boba place in northern Denver suburb. Will come back again for other drinks. Just a little disappointed at the giant boba, which doesn‚Äôt have the consistency of the typical tapioca boba but more like coffee jelly."
1 star,Hands down the worst boba drinks in history that ive tried. I tried almost every local boba place if not all of them and none of them were this bad. We bought a total of 7 drinks some of them not pictured since my friends was eager to get it and go home but all of us have about the same complaint which was it was bland it just tasted like milk and water with little to no tea flavor at all and for sure no sweetness existed. I bought the 6 A drink which was brown sugar with mochi and boba and i can tell you that was the worst drink ever which had the consistency of spoiled milk so it did not pair well with the drink at all and the drink not having any flavor to it did not help it one bit. All my friends who ordered the drink said their drinks were quite flavorless and no sweetness. If i could rate it lower than a 1 star i would. Definitely never coming here again as well as let others know how bad it is here.
5 stars,Me and my 2 teens Love this place especially the black sugar boba it's nice and chewey not hard and their baked goods are fabulous love everything üòçü§©‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä ‚Ä¶
5 stars,"So excited to have a tiger sugar up here finally! Service was very fast and there was no line when we came in thankfully. We got the pudding and coffee ones which were SO good. the staff here is friendly and fast. The parking situation is weird and the location is super tiny with very minimal seating but other than that, I can't complain!"
5 stars,I‚Äôm so happy they opened a location in my neighborhood! I was here for opening day and they gave out freebies for the first 100 customers like they mentioned on Facebook. Love their original tiger drink. I‚Äôll be coming back to try their other drinks!
4 stars,"Really delicious and unique Boba! My only complaint is that the ice ratio is extremely high; I was out of tea really quickly. Would recommend asking for a little less ice in your drink, unless you're really into that sort of thing. Otherwise, very tasty! The giant Boba is delicious and has a great texture too."
2 stars,"I've been to several different boba shops and felt confident in going to a good shop with the 4.3 stars on Google. I had seen the giant boba advertised on Instagram so I came and it was not what I was expecting at all. The other reviews are correct, you can't customize your drinks, what the pictures look like is what you get.

The main problem I had was the boba balls in the giant boba drink are not the typical tapioca boba, but have the consistency of Jello and taste more chemically than brown sugary. While the drink itself was okay, I was really disappointed with the quality of the boba. I couldn't finish the drink which does not happen often for me, the boba was just too gross.

The atmosphere of the store is more of a grab your drink and go place, instead of games and a hangout spot. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's also not the most inviting. It was very clean though which I appreciated. The service was great, no trouble at all and the lady was fast and very nice. She was definitely the best part of my experience at TIGER SUGER Westminster.

With not being able to customize my drink and the lack of quality in the beverage, I most likely will not be back."
2 stars,Much better boba options in the area. I love Tiger Sugar but this location is not great. The other low reviews are accurate and you cannot customize your drinks in any way. They are also not the most friendly staff we‚Äôve seen (could just have been unlucky). We‚Äôve been several times to give it a chance but probably won‚Äôt be back.
1 star,Heard really good things about Tiger Sugar was very underwhelmed. The barista seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. The taro drink tasted just like milk with old boba in it üôÑ and the matcha was bland and also very underwhelming. Very disappointed and the drinks were like $7 a piece.
4 stars,"My girls and I love the Jumbo boba. Service was good. The atmosphere for where it is, is okay. Just got cramped fast when other people where waiting for drinks as well. Really good overall!!"
5 stars,"Clean, friendly staff. Great Bubble teas! Must try."
5 stars,First time I got there. The service was really fast. Clean and warm . My drink soooo delicious. I was love it. I will come again soon!
5 stars,"Drinks are great, snacks are even better. People who leave 1 stars do not know what asian boba drinks taste like, its an acquired taste, dont blame the store if you dont like the taste, its your fault not the drinks."
5 stars,My grandma went in Tuesday afternoon. She has no idea what boba is and the girl in the front stood there for 15 minutes helping her and explaining to her about every drink she was questioning while also helping other customers. She finally decided on the Mango Sago and ordered me their signature. Absolutely amazing service and the loveliest staff. You have to try their drinks. My new go to drink place!! The place itself is very cozy.
1 star,"The boba at this place was absolutely heinous. There was like 8 different textures and no room for customization. I got the Taro one and it was absolutely terrible. It was curdly and weirdly chunky, utter lack of flavor and overall just a terrible drink. I will never be buying a drink from Tiger Sugar again :) don‚Äôt waste ur money here"
2 stars,"Got two drinks for me and my daughter, I got the taro boba (bc they were out of the hello kitty drink) & my daughter got the strawberry mochi

The taro pudding boba had the consistency of milk that was rotten. It didn‚Äôt taste sweet it 100% tasted like it shouldn‚Äôt have with hard flavorless chunks in it . Didn‚Äôt get to try a drink of it until we already left.. the hype wasn‚Äôt worth it"
1 star,If I could give a 0 I would. Came in because I saw a TikTok ad for their giant boba tea drink. Went into the Westminster location and ordered two teas with jumbo Boba and saw a sign saying to shake boba before you drink it. Paid almost 16$ for 2 drinks got in the car tried to take a sip and got a drink of powdery gelatin. I shook both more than necessary and it was absolutely disgusting! Got home and tried to doctor the drink up by boiling the mixture and I tried the giant boba balls which tasted like CHEMICALS. Worst thing I ever drank and tasted! MAYBE DONT ADVERTISE DRINKS THAT ARE OVERPRICED GARBAGE! GO TO KING FU TEA INSTEAD!!
1 star,"Changed to 1 star after realizing they do this to everyone.
As tons of people have already mentioned.  They dont let you customize your drink.  Wanna add boba to a drink that doesnt have it?  They will just tell you no.  Willing to pay extra? Too bad.  They know whats best.  To the owner.  Ease dont paste your generic reply about measuring the best freshest ingredients.  Your customers want something, are willong to pay you more for it, and you tell them no?  Seems pretty stupid.  The only reviews you get that are positive is when ppl just happend to like something youve made the way it comes. I'll just go to literally ANY other place."
4 stars,The service was the best part! I went in for a popcorn chicken - thats all - and it took 25m for it to be prepared. Will be back for Boba; atmosphere is small and clean.
5 stars,One of the best boba‚Äôs I‚Äôve gotten. I love their Mango green tea with regular boba. It‚Äôs the perfect amount of sweetness for me and the ratio of boba to tea is perfect. If you‚Äôre in the area you have to stop by and try this place!
5 stars,"The black sugar boba +pudding milk tea was so good. It was like flan and boba and milk tea in a cup. They have a lot of options and none of them seem to be things you typically find at other boba shops, so I would read the menu before you go. None of my ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù drinks were on the menu. But that led me to explore and go out of my comfort zone!"
3 stars,"Not enough customization. Great staff, very friendly, but the main draw of boba is being able to customize your own drink. Too many things on the menu were not changeable in any way."
5 stars,PERFECT BOBA!! I‚Äôve tried tiger sugar in Aurora and it‚Äôs such a drive but when I found out we had one coming here I couldn‚Äôt wait. It was just as great as the first time. My boyfriend and I loved the number one. You guys hands down have the best boba pearls i've ever tasted too and have such a sweet staff. I cannot wait to keep coming back here.
5 stars,I have tried everything they have on the menu and definitely love this boba shop. The coffee latte and Mango sago are my favorite. I also like the passion fruit tea as their newer arrival.The workers are so friendly and helpful every time I visit too.
1 star,"Ordered a brown sugar boba and a mango one and it had these weird jello pieces in it that tasted like fish. Hands down worst boba ever, do not go here. There was also a weird bug trap thing at the front of the store with dead moths in it. Absolutely disgusting"
2 stars,I‚Äôve never been to a boba shop that doesn‚Äôt allow you to not have ice. Which is kind of annoying because I like to buy drinks for my family members but don‚Äôt want the ice to water down the drinks. Share tea and kung fu tea allow you to customize your orders without a problem
5 stars,strawberry waffle that is really good.. So like it. Is yummy
5 stars,I've been to so many boba places in the Denver metro. I went for the first time to this one yesterday and it was incredible. It was definitely the freshest one I've been to. Can't wait to go back!
5 stars,"I've had a fair amount of boba drinks, but this was my first experience having boba that's so creamy. It was different than what I expected, but very tasty!"
5 stars,"Super cute, clean shop with friendly service and amazing drinks. So excited to have found this spot, definitely worth a try for anyone who loves tea or boba."

5 stars,"I got the strawberry mocha on their grand opening, it‚Äôs my favorite!! Finally it came to Westminster!! I can save my 40mins driving. It‚Äôs as good as always. I got my freeeeee drink as the first 100 customers too! Yeah!"

4 stars,Fast and friendly service with beautiful drinks that taste great and really beat the heat! They gave us a punch card for a free drink so we will be back!
5 stars,I always get the Mochi boba or the brown sugar creme brulee drink and it always hits the spot. Great place for an indulgent sweet treat.
2 stars,Took 30 minutes to get my drink 1:30pm on a Thursday. Only 2 members here who are measuring each ingredient to the gram cresting the hold up. I would say give this place a month to work out these kinks because the wait is not okay.
5 stars,The drinks and desserts are amazing! I love the oolong with cheese mousse and crepe cake!
1 star,I wish they had more flavors! They do so many good collabs but not good flavors ü•≤
5 stars,"I at first gave this place a bad review, but I realized it was actually mine own stupidity that influenced the review and now recognize that the drink was made perfectly, and was actually an amazing drink. Highly suggest going here."
