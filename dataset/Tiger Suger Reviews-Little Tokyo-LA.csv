3 stars,"i cant lie and say i wasnt disappointed when i ordered the same thing here as i did in another branch... that might have been in another country, and received something completely different. it was still okay, but my expectations were shut down so quickly üòî have a look at my other tiger sugar review in montreal and you'll witness true greatness epitomised in a bubble tea beverage

the staff here were really nice at least!"
4 stars,This is the Little Tokyo outlet of Tiger Sugar bubble tea chain. You get to order with a person here as opposed to using a touch screen at some other places. Selection is quite good and they emphasize the variety of sugars and syrups. It is a good choice for Little Tokyo. Of course here you have to use paid parking to enjoy Little Tokyo.
4 stars,"Tried their matcha latte and the strawberry mochi drink, the first was honestly mid but the mochi drink was sweet but good! i would say skip the lattes and go for an specialty drink which is their strongest things on the menu as well seasonal drinks if you have a sweet tooth, there‚Äôs a few tables inside for people to sit down."
2 stars,"The wait wasn't too bad when I got here on a Friday afternoon. It didn't take too long to get my order either.

The tea was more on the bitter and less sugar side; not quite for me. The boba in the Black Sugar boba milk was pretty mushy and it tasted like it was sitting for too long during the cooking process."
4 stars,"Drink markets in Little Tokyo is getting more competitive and another boba store just opened.

We got black sugar boba cream and mango sago drinks, oops forgot to order half sweet and it was a little too sweet.

No complain on quality of drinks.
I don‚Äôt think they are not the best in this area. Definitely best black sugar taste, but you don‚Äôt get many choices besides black sugar.
Boba was a little too firm too.

Mango drink was too thick and sweet for me, the topping was weird (is it pear?), half sweet maybe better."
5 stars,"I got the boba black tea with mochi. It was really good. The owner was around and he's super attentive and made sure you were taken care of. The customer service is really good here. It's a small spot, so not that much room for studying, but I'll definitely pass by anytime I'm in Little Tokyo"
5 stars,"I went in to chat about a job and everyone in the store was so kind. I was offered a drink on the house while I waited, and it was so refreshing. The tea was slightly watery, but otherwise very tasty.

All of the staff were great and took the time to welcome me in and speak with me. The inside of the shop was cozy, and has a great view of the hustle and bustle of Little Tokyo."
5 stars,"The heaven of all things boba! If you already know, you've told your friends. The Thai Tea was perfect!"
5 stars,Owner of this location was hospitable. Provided my friends with sample items for taste testing before we ordered. Boba had good consistency. Milk substitutes available for those who don't want whole milk.
4 stars,"I ordered 3 drinks yesterday and 2 of them were very good! The third one was their brown sugar bubble milk tea, and it was extremely disappointing because it tasted completely like milk and nothing like tea or any other brown sugar drink I've ever tasted. Would definitely recommend people to order other drinks than that one."
5 stars,"Dangerously delicious and addicting. My first try and I got the #3 ""Black Sugar Boba and Pearl Milk Cream Mousse."" Make sure you shake it many times so it mixes well!"
2 stars,"Service was pretty bad. I've had Tiger Sugar in Malaysia all the time, and they taste amazing. Somehow, the branch here in Little Tokyo had bland black sugar cheese mousse bubble tea. I dont know how bubble tea could even taste bland with so much sugar. Might be because they were about to close or prepped the order wrong, will not revisit."
2 stars,"Beware, the prices here are higher than the prices on the menu. Literally scamming you. I asked the lady on register if they know and she told me yes, that the owner haven‚Äôt changed them but they are aware."
5 stars,"Boba was chewy!
Little shop with less than 10 chairs where you can people watch the bustling corner of little Tokyo.
Parking is validated for I think 30 minutes for the attached lot."
1 star,"looks can be deceiving
taste bland
little pearl are sticking together like big balls mushy boba
taste like just milk with burned sugar

its my second time to order , 1st one is in lasvegas. yummy chewy. good. here i dont know what happend"
5 stars,"My friend is a stand seller at little Tokyo so we got bobas and the workers were so nice we even got free water refills for the day ice and the boba was so good, I would definitely recommend the boba and it is one of the best bobas I've ever had in my life. You should also try out the other things like their other bobas and more!!!! Love tiger sugar try it out guyssss yum!"
5 stars,Simple one in a million. Excellent customer service and delicious üòã tea üßã. Costume made your drink ü•§ of choice and nice ambiance. Great kids working together. ‚Ä¶
2 stars,"The female staff member was very kind and likeable, the male staff member wasn't that great but I get it, working minimum wage is exhausting. The rating is really pertaining to the drinks than the staff or even the store itself.

We got the Strawberry Mochi Mousse and it tasted AWFUL! We shook it and it tasted like straight artificial overly sweet flavoring. I love sweets but we only took two sips of our drinks before just throwing the full cups away outside because it was so disgusting. It just tasted so fake and candy-like in the WORST way possible. I got mine with oat milk too, and it somehow added a nutty flavor to the drink but did nothing to make it taste better in any way that mattered.

We got the collab Hello Kitty cups which aren't even reusable, they're just paper cups! What's the point? Plus the tea would leak whenever I tipped the cup even slightly because the film they use to seal the cups was so flimsy. I stirred the straw gently and it tore the film.

Don't waste your money here, Boba Time is right down the street."
5 stars,"Cute little place across from the revolving sushi restaurant. Picked up a Black Sugar Coffee Jelly and a Golden Oolong Tea Latte and they tasted amazing! Service was friendly and the prices are pretty fair compared to lots of other places, especially around Houston!"
5 stars,"Love it! All drinks are so testy!!!  Nice UI design, easy to order. Especially you can adjust your own sugar, ice levels."
3 stars,"I think there is too much hype built up about brown sugar boba! It is very sweet and has a good molasses flavour. It was just too sweet for me personally and not as amazing as the Internet previously made it out to be. I tried coffee jelly for the first time, and it was also not my personal favourite. Sadly, I would have given 4 stars if there wasn't a preset expectation."
5 stars,Delicious signature black sugar boba drinks with a friendly staff and comfy spot for people watching.
4 stars,üëç ‚Ä¶
1 star,Drinks unfortunately were not good. The matcha was gritty and bland. The strawberry tasted artificial. Had higher hopes. The person who checked us out also seemed to be having a bad day.
5 stars,Quaint little spot that deserves more love. Got a regular black sugar milk tea boba and it was excellent.
5 stars,The worker Steven I believe his name was is such a good worker! My first time ever trying tiger sugar I did not know what to order and he helped me choose and asked me to try one of his favorite orders! It was super delicious and i‚Äôm glad he was so kind enough to do that for me :) 10/10 would go back! He remembers me as well and makes me the order when he is there!
3 stars,I have had better boba elsewhere. We ordered a lychee tea with small boba.
2 stars,"The guys are a bit rude and not giving much care. Watched another customer walk out and I should have taken it as a sign. 2/3 the drinks were fine, but my sister's drink tasted like straight milk. The guy gave her attitude to remake but she stood her ground and got it. Tasted more like the one I got at the end."
3 stars,"The drinks tasted ok.  It took forever to use their credit card machine to pay for our drinks.  The cashier had to remove the cord, install it again, and take our orders again to make the credit card machine work.  The drinks were already ready when we are finally able to pay.  I hope they‚Äôll figure out a better way to pay by card."
3 stars,"Been here a few times, pretty solid boba shop. But your employee Julian was a bit too aggressive I‚Äôm usually very lenient because I understand people can have a bad day but like the sarcasm and aggressive behavior ruined this place for me."
2 stars,"jumbo ‚Äúboba‚Äù is NOT actually boba!! it‚Äôs balls of coffee jelly. didn‚Äôt taste bad, but was bland and very disappointing. badly advertised and incredibly misleading - for $8, definitely not worth it. however, workers were super nice and i hear their fruit teas are delicious."
1 star,"I had high expectations about this place because people usually say that it‚Äôs good but from what I experienced all I could say is that I will not be coming back to this place, the boba drink that I also got was too bland, no flavor or anything. Highly disappointed. Will stick to my 7leaves, tea is much better there"
1 star,"The non-asian male cashier conversed, responded, and asked questions with a customer without looking at them. Wonder if that's how their parents taught them but I suggest they must have their manager reeducate them again."
3 stars,"They have 3.5 üåü for a reason. Rude af and had to ask them to seal my drink (since I'll be walking around & didn't want to spill drink) was told they don't do it for kitty crush, yet when I asked they were sealing another 2 cups of kitty crush, make it make sense. Promo stated that if I bought a drink the sleeve would be 9.99 yet paid 12.99. At ktown, a friend bought 1 drink & 1 sleeve and got the promo but apparently regardless of 1 sleeve per person limit they just even bother to explain that I needed to buy another drink for the promo to work. Not sure if I'm gonna make the trip in the future to come here since it's a 30 min drive from home."
1 star,"Rude, poorly trained, unfriendly staff, and they got my order wrong. Although to be fair, even when they get your order right, the drinks here are sub-par at best. Do yourself a favor and walk across the street to Sunright or Gong Cha. Sunright even validates, which Tiger does not."
1 star,"The drink was okay at best. I mostly remember what a nasty attitude the cashier had. I visited on July 15, 2022 around 7pm and the cashier was a heavy set girl with curly hair. I simply and politely asked her if the drinks came with boba and she sighed looking very annoyed as she pointed to the drink where it says it contained pearls. I have never been to this shop before so I just wanted to clarify what is the problem with that? There was hardly anyone inside at the time what could be so difficult about answering a simple question? That was the first and last time I will ever go there. If you're looking for delicious bubble tea you will not find it here there are so many other options nearby."
4 stars,"Soooo sweeet !
Brown sugar boba is amazing ! summer match !"
1 star,"The worst boba drink I have ever had. Super watery, you absolutely don‚Äôt taste any tea at all. Overcooked boba - $7"
1 star,"They're stingy with their syrups, because the drinks come out tasting so weird and missing sweetness. The first time i went , it was perfect but these last three times I've gone, I'm basically paying for $6 for a cup of milk with a dash of syrup. So disappointing every time."
1 star,"Ordered a Black Sugar Pudding Cream Milk Tea and the boba pearls were not sweet at all, was bland. The Milk Tea itself was not sweet as well. You could mostly taste only the milk. Was disappointed."
1 star,"Ordered green tea latte with half the sugar, tasted like sugar water, my daughter's black tea latte with recommended sweetness tasted like there was no sugar, and my little one never got her drink because they were out of strawberry jam. Still waiting for my refund."
4 stars,"I always love the service but I feel bad for the baristas I understand natural lighting, but the sun light are in their faces. Besides that I love the boba and the drink I always get the number 2 off the menu ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
1 star,Their black sugar boba is horrible! Tastes like pure whole milk and the boba tastes very watery and old! Highly disappointed
1 star,"The staff didn‚Äôt shake the tea well, all the syrup just sticks at the bottom and it‚Äôs really sweet without mixing."
5 stars,"First tasted tiger sugar abroad, and it tastes the same here. Staff were very kind. Delicious boba, would recommend if you‚Äôre stopping by little tokyo."
1 star,"Tastes like sugar water and milk with boba. Doesn't taste like tea at all, and may not even have any tea. Technically, there's no mention of the word ""tea"" for #1 and #2 ""black sugar milk boba"", so who knows if it is even supposed to be tea. Very confusing, a bubble tea shop where the top 5 items are not even tea. Who drinks just sugar and milk without any tea? Go home, pour yourself some cold milk, dump a bunch of sugar in it, and that's what this is."
1 star,"I asked specifically for 100% sweetness and it tastes like plain water with tea, can't even taste the black sugar flavor

There's always Big line but that's only because there's barely any employees working, not worth the wait"
5 stars,I got their signature drink not too long ago and I can say it‚Äôs one of the best! As to the cashier they told me it was their most popular drink and I see why! I would be getting more drinks from there.
5 stars,It is my favorite place to get boba! I make the trek from the westside just for this! Don‚Äôt miss out!
4 stars,"Service is slow and they put a 3 leches cake in the cardboard box without any protection and it made a mess all over the place.
Not cool."
2 stars,Boba literally sucked so bad. Came out of state for plain starch balls.
1 star,my drink was full of ice and the matcha was very very very light.
