5 stars,"It was my first time trying their Bubble tea, and it is really good! The waiting time is short. I also appreciate the convenience of being able to order either online or at a kiosk.
I recommend the Black Sugar Boba.üßã ‚Ä¶"
4 stars,"i had 2 different drinks from this location. the first was the strawberry mochi, which was fine, though not sweet almost at all. but, the second was amazing. it was the strawberry slush, i highly recommend that drink!"
1 star,"Shake 15 times. The cups lid where the seal met exploded on both my mine and my friends tea now our jackets, pants, and hand is covered in sugar. Never has this happened to me ordered many times from this location. Annoyed yo the max will have to dry clean my jacket now which I just did last week."
1 star,"Rude lady. Got a #10. The straw provided was way too small and kept falling in. When asked for a straw that would actually fit, she rudely replied that they just have one size.
How am I even supposed to drink this. Never coming here again."
5 stars,This place is a nice boba tea shop!üßã Tiger Sugar üêØ in Korea Town üóΩ serves an endless selection of delicious ü§§ milk ü•õ tea üçµ drinks! ü•§ They even have Jumbo Boba! ‚ö´  I can adjust the amount of sugar and ice üßä in each drinks and easily order through an automated kiosk tablet. üì± Service is super quick. ‚è≤Ô∏è  I wish I came here more often!
5 stars,My new favorite boba place! Try their popular brown sugar milk tea with less sugar and less ice. I prefer it with no cream. Their strawberry mochi is also pretty good!
5 stars,"Tiger sugar is the best bubble tea spot in NYC. THAT BROWN SUGAR IS TO DIE FOR! customers service is relatively fast, depending on whose there. But sometimes I see mad orders and 2 workers. They pump out them teas like a factory while maintaining quality control."
5 stars,This is one my favorite bubble tea spots in manhattan. It's in such a central location and easy to get to. I think they have one of the tastiest bobas ever. I highly recommend their brown sugar milk and the taro milk drink.
5 stars,"My favorite tiger sugar in the city.

Is it pricey? Yes
Is it yummy? Totally
Is it worth it? Hello yes hell yea

They offer milk alternatives like soy, coconut, oat for lactose haters like me. I recommend coconut milk! The mango pomelo is also delicious and my go to if I‚Äôm looking for something refreshing"
5 stars,"One of the best places for bubble tea.
Theres only 2 self checkout kiosks and people take so long to put in their order. ‚Ä¶"
5 stars,"Authentic Taiwanese boba with great prices and so many flavors to choose from the menu. I particularly like the fact that they have a touch screen in front of the store for self-order. It's a game changer. It makes everything easier, faster and less awkward especially for busy people like I am. I can simply order by myself and adjust the drinks the way I like it without having to answer questions from a cashier person. Smart operation! Highly recommended!"
4 stars,Got mango sago. It was great but the mango wasn‚Äôt ripe. It was noticeably hard and sour. My wife got lychee tea (F4) and we loved it!! Has a strong flavor but isn‚Äôt too sweet which I find is rare as far as lychee stuff goes. Staff was rude honestly. Definitely don‚Äôt go if you have hearing issues as the person behind the register was impatient with me for not being able to hear her as I lip read a lot and she had a mask on.
5 stars,"Really yummy bubble tea! There‚Äôs always a line but wanted to try. You can order at kiosk outside or scan to order online.
Love that there is a non-dairy option (soy milk). The black sugar boba is delish. Yes, it‚Äôs a little sweet and you can‚Äôt adjust the sweetness on the milk teas but it was good. Really good price too.
I went back and tried their matcha and mango boba drinks. As a huge matcha addict, it wasn‚Äôt as good as I expected but the mango was tasty. I think they excel with their tiger sugar milk teas."
1 star,The staff treat blacknpeople like trash. I asked staff add more sugar before they made the drink.they didn't listen. When I asked 2nd time they gavevme attitude speech they can't add more sugar after spending $8.hire more inclusive staff there all asian.this os america share dollar
5 stars,"Tiger sugar is Top 3 of my favourite bubble tea store in NYC.  Black Sugar Boba with Pearl Milk is the best for me.

Caution: Finding the right sweetness balance is crucial. Be mindful to ensure your preference aligns with the sweetness offered for the best enjoyment."
4 stars,"Came by in the afternoon to try the Hello Kitty crush but disappointed to find out that it already sold out for the day. All the drinks do come in the Hello Kitty cups though so that's a good consolation.

There are two tablets to order from, one inside and one outside the store. There were only two people working when I visited so the staff made the drinks in batches. It was the first time I ever waited 20 minutes for a bubble tea drink."
2 stars,Ordered a BS milk with boba & cream mousse yesterday 4pm and there was no cream mousse in it. I was mostly craving the cream mousse :( Like that‚Äôs only 2 toppings when the store‚Äôs empty with 1 drink waiting on the counter how do you even miss that?? Gimme my money backüôÑ ‚Ä¶
4 stars,"It's a pretty small place, has a kiosk outside to order at. The wait time is a bit long but the drinks were all very good!!"
4 stars,"I‚Äôve heard about this place and have been wanting to try it in forever. Finally got to check it out today with my coworker, second bubble tea shop this year around the area after trying fiftylan last week. Pricing is cheaper here compared to fiftylan and drinks are comparable.

Decent bubble tea shop, could use friendlier staff though, kiosks shows you more options than ordering with a person, they also only take cash if you order with the staff. I‚Äôd pick the kiosks going forward with my experience. You can also get points and redeem it in the future for a free drink.

I picked their signature drink, brown sugar boba with less ice and less sugar and whole milk and cream on the top. Good to try if you haven‚Äôt had it. The tapioca came in different sizes which threw me off a bit, haven‚Äôt had mixed size bubble/pearls so that was interesting. Flavor is pretty authentic coming from someone who drinks bubble tea growing up in taiwan :) so good to give it a shot!

I went right around when they opened so there was no line, around 12:35ish."
5 stars,Escaped the rain and we were going to try another Boba place close to BCD but drinks were $10+. Ran into this shop and tried the fresh taro with small boba..holy molay that was good
5 stars,"So glad that I no longer need to travel to Chinatown or Flushing for Tiger Sugar!

I stopped by on a Thursday night, and the service was fast! This location is slightly smaller than the one in Chinatown.

I had to get my favorite - no. 5 black sugar boba + pudding milk with cream mousse. Yum!

I liked the idea of having a paper straw -  but guess what, it doesn't work on the film that was covering the drink!

The drink was delicious, creamy, and the black sugar boba was divine - this is coming from someone that doesn't like bobas.

The only thing I'd suggest for this business is to serve it with less ice. I was having a hard time fishing out my pudding and boba as they were sitting underneath all the ice cubes."
5 stars,"Probably only place with boba coffee with pearls, both hot and cold. Loved it, Def going back to try different things next time. Healthy and customizable"
2 stars,"I‚Äôm a weekly boba drinker, and this is one of the worst bubble teas I‚Äôve had in NYC. I got the brown sugar milk tea with tapioca, and it was almost all ice and water with little flavor. I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre using covered cups to deter you from seeing how it‚Äôs all ice. I can‚Äôt believe I wasted $7.50 on this when there are so many options in K-Town. I do not recommend."
5 stars,Went two days in a row! Had black tea with black sugar boba with 50% sugar. The tea has a strong tea flavor which we love. Some places you can tell the tea was light and watered down. The boba has soft texture and good black sugar flavor. ‚Ä¶
5 stars,"The boba is really good. Lines aren‚Äôt very long or slow, so it‚Äôs great. The service was good and there are many fruit options which I really liked. Definitely a place to check out."
5 stars,"I'm so happy that another location opened! You can't go wrong with their signature drink.
It's definitely a closer location for me and their drinks are always delicious! ‚Ä¶"
1 star,"I ordered 3 Milk Boba Pearl Tiger Jelly drinks; I asked for less ice and instead got the whole cup full of ice- I could barely taste the drink. üò± For my 3 extra large drinks order I was offered no bag to carry it all and no straws. When I asked for a bag and straws,  the lady at the counter without saying a word threw my drinks into a bag and pushed it towards me‚Ä¶

Honestly, I don‚Äôt get this attitude.
I suppose, it‚Äôs a way of showing me that I didn‚Äôt add a tip when ordering my drinks at their touch screen menu‚Ä¶?  The place doesn‚Äôt even have a seating area; you order your $8 drink and go; why tips are being extorted?"
5 stars,"Been coming to Tiger Sugar for years now, mainly the Ctown location. So it‚Äôs great to see them in Koreatown. The drinks are great and the staff are always helpful. You can order in person, via kiosk, or from Snackpass (online). I recommend getting their signature, #1 but definitely should try others if you can!"
5 stars,Most amazing boba I've ever had ü•∞ü•∞ so delicious and chewy! Perfect level of sweet. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a treat!
2 stars,"not the typical type of boba drinks. If you are looking for dessert-like drinks then this may be the place for you. We ordered boba pudding milk tea. The milk tea and boba are pale, even soulless. The ingredient ratio is off. Tastes like a combination of different types of artificial sweets. Not worth the wait and definitely won‚Äôt come back."
5 stars,Finally tried their boba and loved it. My bf had the Mochi one w tapioca and I had the large tapioca brown sugar. The wait line is long but it‚Äôs really convenient to order through their self service machine.
5 stars,Whenever I go to K-town I come here for boba. Just wanted to give my thanks to the worker here this evening on Nov. 26 who held onto the bag I had forgotten. I could have lost my shoes for good ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Ä¶
4 stars,Drinks were great! Had lactose free options which was great because my stomach doesn‚Äôt digest whole milk well. Had topping free options which was great too. One thing I would say is that it had too much ice which forces you to drink slowly. Overall great place for bubble tea especially for the price.
5 stars,Tried the bs mik boba tea. I'll say i loved it
4 stars,"They have a good quality of bubble tea they have a signature drink which is the most selling bubble tea and I would also recommend the same for the first timers here as you can order that blindly‚Ä¶ the space is small and one this was off that we can only at by cars through the kiosk ,they only accept cash over the counter‚Ä¶"
4 stars,"Good boba milk tea store. A good variety of selections.

The strawberry mochi is good. Not too sweet and I totally love the mochi. It‚Äôs very chewy.

Brown sugar matcha latte is okay. Nothing special. Some of the matcha powder is not even dissolved."
3 stars,No wonder the store went from waiting 10 mins in line to hardly any customers. We love you guys but our drink tasted like milk with a hint of sweetness.
5 stars,This place ranks high on my list of favorite bubble tea spots in Manhattan. Its central location makes it easily accessible. They serve some of the finest boba I've ever tasted. I highly recommend their brown sugar milk and taro milk drinks.
1 star,Not good. It wasn‚Äôt refreshing or tasty at all tbh i wish i didn‚Äôt spend so much on this. Mango pomelo tastes like it was canned and is way too sweet & artificial tasting i cannot finish the drink.
5 stars,"There Mango-sago is so good!! I eventually drank it so much, that I retired from getting it.  BEST DRINK!!!"
5 stars,Love that the quality stays consistent no matter where you go. I always recommend their #1 to friends. Definitely one of the best brown sugar boba I've had outside of Taiwan. I also appreciate the lactose free milk option rather than just almond/oat/coconut milk. Prices are reasonable for NYC. Service was fast and friendly. Would come back again.
1 star,"I love bubble tea and have tried many places in NYC, but my last visit here was the worst. I ordered a mango sago and waited over 20 minutes. When I checked with the male staff after receiving a ""ready"" text, his attitude was unpleasant and rude, and he said the message was wrong and you should only come here when calling you. Even after customers who ordered after me got their drinks, mine was still not ready, and he didn‚Äôt give me a clear time. Eventually, the female staff delivered my drink. On a hot day, my friends and I waited 20 minutes in the sun, dealing with this rude service. I won't be back and suggest others avoid this place due to the poor service and long wait times. Not worth it!"
5 stars,"Excellent brown sugar milk tea üßã
The taste of the milk is so good. Very creamy andthe sweetness is just right. They don‚Äôt let you choose the sweetness level but the taste is the best.
The pearls are so soft and chewy!!!!! So so good!!!"
4 stars,You order and pay on the automated machine and then wait while they complete your order. The wait was a bit long and the space is very small and no place to sit. But the drinks were great.
1 star,"Sometime when boba sold out, they will put only brown sugar sauce but no boba in your tea. Check it before leaving. Enjoy :("
5 stars,"As a Taiwanese, the taste is exact the same as I drink in Taiwan. However the price is about 3 times expensive than in Taiwan.
Yet, in the states, if I can get something taiwan flavor, it is worth you to spend some money on it."
5 stars,"I‚Äôve been a fan of their Brown Sugar Boba ever since, so I‚Äôm glad that they have the XL option now. I got the one with the pudding and it‚Äôs amazing!"
5 stars,"Back here again!! I love it!! Brown sugar boba!! It‚Äôs so fresh and refreshing!!
Will keep coming back!! It‚Äôs one of my favorite in the city!!!"
4 stars,They have branched out their offerings. It used to be solely on brown sugar bubble teas varieties but now they have other offerings just like a common bubble tea joins. A little disappointed of their new concept. Personally I think they should just exclusively do variety of brown sugar  offerings.
5 stars,This is the best tasting boba I‚Äôve had and it‚Äôs also like the cheapest I‚Äôve gotten too. If you‚Äôre in Ktown you gotta hit up tiger sugar!
1 star,A long hair stuck inside between the drink sealing. I am concerned about safety and sanitation of all these drinks from this store.
5 stars,I ordered a peach oolong tea and a passion fruit oolong tea with bubbles. They were both so delicious. Cannot wait to come back!
5 stars,Got the mango sago and really liked it. Good flavor and toppings with the coconut jelly as well. Tall size too.
2 stars,"Ughhh. I love their bubble tea, especially their boba. But it‚Äôs really disappointing this time. I ordered with pudding and paid extra. But there‚Äôs no pudding inside."
5 stars,"The taro milk was THE BEST taro milk that I ever had! It had fresh taro, taro pudding, creame mousse, boba, and I picked oat milk. 10/10 it was perfect and I definitely will be coming back!"
5 stars,"Used the ordering machine in front of the store, which was a bit slow. But dont be fooled! They have another ordering machine in the store!

But the drink was nice, as usual!"
4 stars,"Loved the taste of the drinks!
The only reason I‚Äôm not giving it 5 stars is because of the service. They seemed annoyed with the rush and filled the cup with 2/3rd ice even after we specified ‚Äòless ice‚Äô"
1 star,"The drinks were very disgusting, it's like no sugar was added to them. I don't suggest going to this business to buy any drinks. ü§Æüëéüèæ
I literally had to add coconut milk to my drink."
1 star,"One of the worst drinks I've ever had in my entire life. Despite the boba tasting decent, something was mixed throughout my entire drink that I've never had in any other similar drink. Throughout was a mucus like substance that had no flavor and was difficult to both get through the straw and consume. There was also a powder present throughout the drink as well, probably due to poor mixing. The employee spoke not a word to anyone and just made these horrible drinks in silence. We tried this place based on the glowing reviews but it definitely was not up to the level of expectations some seem to have. Either better training needs to be performed or different recipes need be crafted. The location and the general vibe of the music and design were the only saving graces."
5 stars,Everything I‚Äôve had here has been amazing! Last time I got the most popular one with the 2 different sizes of boba and it was fantastic.
5 stars,"Very good bubble tea, one of the bests!"
1 star,"For some reason the counter is CASH ONLY which is fine but to pay card is $7 for a green tea instead of $6. We all trying to survive out here but this level is a little outrageous. Also the clerk had no intention of being there, and was colder than my ice green tea on a rainy october night."
5 stars,"I wish I took a picture before I drank it, but I got the strawberry mochi since i‚Äôm not a milk tea person and I tell you Tiger Sugar did not disappoint me. Went home dancing and I want more üòå Great Job!"
3 stars,"good bubble tea it has small little pearls and big pearls, but it didnt have the wow factor i expected. its regualt bubble tea with condensed milk flavor."
5 stars,"NGL, best boba tea I have ever had. This might just be the only thing I will miss about NYC!"
5 stars,"Best bubble tea place I've tried in Manhattan, their tapioca is so soft and chewy, and ice and sugar levels are customizable to fit your liking! They also have cold as well as hot options, which is great for when it's cold outside."
5 stars,"Very good place. I like how they put both boba and pearl. They don‚Äôt let you change the size, ice, or sugar level. I understand that they do it to keep the same consistency, but I wish if they allow for more options."
4 stars,Tiger sugar always is my favorite boba tea .
4 stars,"Love love love the brown sugar drink. So sweet and great. Somewhat of a long wait though, and they were out of large bubbles and substituted small pearls."
5 stars,"Most of the time I get the brown sugar iced latte with bubbles (pictured) only because I usually need a pick-me up. You can‚Äôt go wrong with their bubble tea though, the best in the city."
5 stars,"There is a QR code on a A frame board, that‚Äôs how you place an order. Easy system to use. Drinks came quickly and tasted delicious."
5 stars,"I really liked ordering on a kiosk and not taking up any staff time, and I liked that it sent you a text when your order was ready, I just wish the staff didn‚Äôt send it preemptively. The brown sugar milk was fantastic, and my fianc√© got the taro which had good taste, but was a tad grainy. I may go back when I visit NYC again."
5 stars,So pricey but this is the only place that offers lactaid milk as an option. Thank you for saving my stomach and toilet üôè ‚Ä¶
1 star,"I'm currently still in store 25mins after ordering two fruit teas and have no drink in hand. The girl behind counter is stacking the new orders on top of the older orders. Orders placed after mine have been made & picked up. I've had better drinks from other places and add the wait time, I will never return here."
5 stars,"Very impressed with this bubble tea shop in Korea Town. It‚Äôs clean and run very efficiently. There‚Äôs a kiosk outside for self order/check out. You can also order via QR code on your phone, but note that it requires you to confirm your card information several times.

Once your order is placed, you are given a number that appears on a large display over the counter. The drink is made quickly and was delicious although the less sugar option was not sweet enough, so I‚Äôll try the regular option next time! üßã"
4 stars,"If you want bubble tea on steroids, then this place is it. Extremely unhealthy and super sugary but if you want an indulgent treat, suggest you head here. You can order from the kiosk to save time. Drinks are all super dense and filling."
3 stars,The worker was very rude to me when I asked for an extra cup and when I was ordering my items she spoke extremely low and I could barely hear anything she was saying to me.She gave me attitude and rolled her eyes at me because I wanted a cup. I understand it‚Äôs not easy working for long hours but it‚Äôs important to treat nice customers with decency. I felt very uncomfortable I even forgot to get a straw for my boba.
4 stars,I ordered Matcha Latte Bubble Tea for me and my friends as a treat. I can tell good bubbles from not so good ones based on the fragrance from cooking bubble pearls with brown sugar.  Our drinks tasted yummy and the bubbles are flavorful and chewy. Wish there are some outdoor seating available. Will come visit again.
5 stars,"this is my favorite place to get a dirty milk tea. they mix in tiny and normal sized tapioca pearls which is the best thing ever because they‚Äôre soft and satisfactory every visit ! it‚Äôs very easy to order boba at the one booth located near the front door, the wait time is usually never too bad even when busy. a bit pricey, but worth the splurge every once in a while."
5 stars,One of the best bubble tea in city. You can make your selection of how you would like your bubble tea. Can order in the shop using the shop tablets stand near by the door and pay using contactless payment.
4 stars,Brown sugar drink was good given the hype! Glad I was able to try it at least once. The staff were really nice.
4 stars,"- great milk tea coffee - not too sweet nor sugary at ""less sugar""
- needed to add more ice; the ice melted so quickly that the drink became warm
- super cute cup with collab with Hello Kitty

Inside the store:
- 0 seating
- small bar area where you can stand and drink for 2-3 people

Easy grab and go place."
5 stars,"Best boba in the city!
The taro is one of the best flavors.
It‚Äôs pretty quick when you order from the app Snackpass, otherwise you can order from the screen and it easy also."
5 stars,One of my favorite place to go.
4 stars,"Staff was helpful when I was struggling with their tablet to order a drink. The drink was good, but the boba was cold and chewy toward the evening. Wish they had kept it heated regardless of the time, but I will try to come back earlier in the day next time."
1 star,"I want to share the horrible experience @K-town location with the worker who claims to be the manager at the location. I ordered Boba w/ Cream Mousse with Lactose Free and Cheese Mousse. I was waiting for my drinks when the employee called out my number. He just initially said, ""we cannot make this drink"". I was confused, so I asked, ""why not?"" and he said he cannot add cheese mousse on a drink that has lactose free option. I told him that it's okay b/c I'm actually not lactose-intolerant, but I prefer to drink it for the taste. He then took it back to his co-worker and looked like they were discussing something. He called me again then said, ""we cannot do it"". And I asked for explanation and he said, ""If something happens, we cannot be responsible."" So I told him that I always order it lactose-free with cheese mousse and then he said something outrageous, ""it's company policy and we cannot do it"". I then mentioned that if that's company policy, there shouldn't be an option to add it on the ordering kiosk system and if that's the case, it should've been written somewhere. He didn't reply to my response and just repeatedly said, ""we cannot do it."" No apologies, no thorough explanation, but rude response with lack of customer service. I asked for a manager, but he said he was the manager. If that's the case, Tiger Sugar should really work on educating managers on how to handle customer service. I'm a fan of Tiger Sugar, but I never want to visit K-town location for the rude employee there."
5 stars,This is the best boba shop I‚Äôve ever been to!!
5 stars,Never disappoints. My favorite boba place in all of NYC.
1 star,"I really like tiger sugar but this store has the worst service! Will not return again! The worker was rude to customers and when I ask for a bag, she is like ‚Äúze‚Äù and when I tell her my number and said that one is my drink, she did not give it to me even though I repeated my number twice! I understand they are tired but please have a better attitude when you facing your customers! The taste is weird!"
5 stars,"Absolutely wonderful food on the 39th floor of the Nomad Tower. The food is equal to the view. We will be back. Attentive service, good meat, and a unique view."
5 stars,"Very strong tea flavor. Love it. But if you prefer something sweeter, better add some sugar."
5 stars,Really good bubble tea! Favorite spot in Korea town!
2 stars,"I like the tiger sugar, but not the 32nd location. Yesterday I asked to put me less ice, to which the girl at the counter answers me no.  I asked why?  She replies that she can't give me less ice.  I don't understand why it's so hard to take and put less ice?  And the guy next to her answers me that they cannot, as it seems to be the rules of the company.  I was surprised.  In all places where bubble tea is sold, people can adjust the amount of ice at will.
Well, in the end I waited for my drink, I ordered a matcha.  And unfortunately, the drink was made bitter.  The last time I was here, it was delicious and sweet, but this time the matcha turned out to be bitter."
5 stars,"Happy to find this in ktown! Loved my drink and even though there's a line, you get it pretty quick!"
5 stars,"The chocolate malt flavor is way better than you think, I promise you. Try it."
3 stars,"I really like this boba place, but the wait was so atrocious. They got the order wrong as well. I ordered 50% ice, and had no ice in my drink I waited 20 minutes for. Everyone has off days, but this was a disappointment."
5 stars,"seriously my favorite boba place, but I recommend having two workers on the weekend, took a long time to get my drink, not the employees fault he was moving very fast, but it‚Äôs an inconvenience for him and the customers. please have at least two people!"
4 stars,"Small shop, with a kiosk to put in your orders. The drinks are good as expected from Tiger Sugar. The wait and the prices can be a bit high for some people. I go when I notice there is no line. Otherwise, I don't bother."
5 stars,"Fast order and pick up process, delicious strawberry mochi bubble tea, overall great bubble tea spot in Koreatown."
5 stars,"Newest tiger sugar location in Koreatown! They launched three new drinks as well: Mango Pomelo Sago, Taro Pudding Black Sugar Boba Milk, and Matcha Black Sugar Boba Milk. I really really love the bubbles/ boba here. They‚Äôre warm and perfectly chewy. It‚Äôs a grab and go location. Would recommend."
5 stars,Taro pudding is THE BEST. I love the fresh taro and the pudding mixed in. Next level treat. Line can be long so be prepared with some patience. It's worth the wait.
5 stars,This stuff is crack! First time trying it and I‚Äôm obsessed. Great place to go on a date
4 stars,"Boba was really good! But it is a tiny shop and can get very busy, and the kiosk ordering system doesn‚Äôt really let you customize your drink."
5 stars,Always had a good moment after drink Tiger Sugar
4 stars,It's tiger sugar. The hello kitty cup got me. Other than that it's just tiger sugar.
5 stars,"Why the reviews are so low, it‚Äôs great bubble tea ever"
1 star,"Well to the girl that‚Äôs working 7/29 around 2 pm

I don‚Äôt know why my drink was there already and I told her my number twice she just wouldn‚Äôt give me my drink because they didn‚Äôt press the number on the screen for my number.

It‚Äôs not like there are lots ppl waiting or very busy.

She just looked at me and told me to wait ?
Like i literally saw my drink there and why did you have to give me such an attitude ?

Well I even put in a tip, I would rather throw them away than have to deal with this attitude for no reason ."
5 stars,Good Location and Classic Taste.
1 star,"So rude! I asked the staff to put a little less boba in my boba tea before she even starting making it since I couldn‚Äôt choose no boba. Her answer: NO. lol.
Its not like the were busy. I was the first customer and no one else was there.
Terrible place."
1 star,"July 10  2.25 pm

guys you working to slow, alot costumer wait"
4 stars,"obsessed, just wish the wait time wasnt always like 10 minutes üò©"
5 stars,"This place is much better than Biao Sugar. I normally don‚Äôt like bobas, but this place‚Äôs bobas are soft and flavorful. I ate all the bobas in my drink and liked them."
3 stars,"The service is not the greatest, head to 50 Lan one block down instead. Or try another branch. The boba is comparable and there‚Äôs more space to sit there."
4 stars,This was one of the best boba drinks we tried here! The drinks tasted so rich and flavorful! Must try!!!
4 stars,"Pretty quick service, they were closing.  The bubbles were in 2 different sizes, super tiny AND regular.  That was interesting.  Clear signage in Chinese and English. $6 for a regular size..."
5 stars,Grand opening in KTOWN. I tried something different this time. The Oolong tea latte is as good as their signature brown sugar milk tea. . I love it !
5 stars,"Great drink !! My fav spot but i am not sure about the staff who is taking the order ,its seem like i ask for free drink ! ;("
1 star,They use Silk for oat milk. Don‚Äôt order with oat milk. Please switch to Oatly or Minor Figures
1 star,The drink was delicious but was 90% Ice. Other NYC locations are much more generous with servings given.

5 stars,Place is tasty and boba's are fresh...
