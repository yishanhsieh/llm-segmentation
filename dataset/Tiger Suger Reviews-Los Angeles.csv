4 stars,This is the Colima outlet of Tiger Sugar boba tea chain. I just tried the black sugar boba with cream large size. I tried this before but this cup had less flavor and not as good as before. This location is inside the strip mall for a drug store chain on the east end.
5 stars,"The service was amazing, always making sure that the drink I got was perfect or he'd offer to re-do it which goes to show how much they care about their product. Staff was super friendly and the good amazing"
5 stars,"First time seeing no huge crowd waiting in line in front of the shop, so I had to stop and get some super famous brown sugar (Tiger Sugar) boba milk tea. They were good, as the ones in Taiwan. Don't compare the price, it costs so much more to hire people than in Taiwan. I don't live close enough to drink this everyday or whenever I want. As long as it tastes good when I get it, I am satisfied."
3 stars,"I guess they had their grand opening a few weeks ago but it's still pretty crowded. It took about 15 mins for us to get through the order line and another 15 mins to get our order. It's honestly not bad but not great either...but for almost $6 for a boba drink, I would go somewhere else until the lines die down. Their bathroom looks like it's still under construction with no hooks for purses and tape on the mirrors. There was also a guy putting up their sign outside that took up some parking spaces. Maybe I've had brown sugar boba already so I'm not super wowed by it, but still try it for yourself to judge whether it's worth the wait or not."
5 stars,"Unparalleled service. We walked in and were immediately greeted with a warm welcome. The owner suggested the brown sugar boba with tea after we were being indecisive.
He then made it quickly and it was so delicious. The boba is perfectly soft and chewy."
5 stars,Wow! They opened a Tiger Sugar here in Rowland Heights! I believe the last time I had this was over a year ago in Taiwan. Glad to see some of these places that are popular in Taiwan come to the states. It seems like they have an easy online …
5 stars,"Went on a weekday night so there was no line.  The drinks are on the sweet side so ask for half sugar.  Had the #1 drink the most popular one, wish the tea taste a bit stronger but the milk was prefect.  $5 for the drink"
5 stars,"So many places that offer drinks with boba in the area, but this was the spot. It was small, no seating inside. It was crowded and you need to wait outside when you order. The store needs to add more seating outside. I will definitely go again. 5 minutes from the 60 fwy. Pricey."
5 stars,This place has very limited options but to be honest that is wonderful because you get in and out real quickly. The drinks are definitely delicious. The time to make an order varies by day and time. But it is totally worth just trying out this place at least ones but I suggest asking what is the most favorite item. They have traditional Boba and sago the smaller version of it. They're both chewy and sweet.
5 stars,I’ve been heard my friends talk about this place for a long time. We waited for a little while and got into the store. My expectation was too high but it’s still decent boba for me. I like the milk and  I think the milk that they use is different from others. But if you ask me to spend 2 hours waiting in line that’s impossible.
4 stars,"We ordered 3 large Brown Sugar Boba milk tea; $19 and some changes.  The boba textures were little too sticky outside and semi hard on the inside, so we concluded that their boba pearls were not fresh at that particular time (around 1pm). The brown sugar syrup flavor dominates the main taste which is nice.  We will try again next time and hope to gain better experience."

3 stars,"Stopped by this place on our drive back to see what the hype is all about. I ordered #1, tasted pretty good but not to my liking. The boba tastes too caramel-y for me. I still prefer Happy Lemon better."
5 stars,"Amazing boba! Despite the look, it’s not overly sweet or too milky. If you want different texture of boba, try #5! I’d definitely line up again for this drink✨"
5 stars,"Tiger Sugar is an absolute must stop every time we visit Frank and Sons comic book warehouse.  The boba is PERFECT and the Thai tea is sweet and smooth.  On a personal level I'm a fan of the tiger motif and am excited to stop by every though I actually find boba reprehensible. But this is one of the few places my teenage daughter still enjoys so for that alone, five stars."
5 stars,"At first I didn’t expect much because how simple looking and fast it was, but when I had a taste, it was just! AMAZING. The taste lasted in my mouth and it tasted really good. The staff was also friendly with me! The line was long though, but it went really quick! The milk tea wasn’t very sweet or too plain, I highly recommend it!"
5 stars,Classic Black Sugar Boba Milk Tea. Love the dairy change option as soy/oat/almond without extra charge.
5 stars,"Even in quarantine, the boba is outstanding and tastes unique for its performance. I got the brown sugar boba and it was an entirely different experience from other boba shops. I'm definitely coming here if I want a different taste next time!"
4 stars,Drinks were very social media worthy which I feel is the main reason people come here. Ordered #1 brown sugar milk tea with cream and it was pretty good. Flavor lasted wonderfully throughout the drink and pearls were made well too. Slightly overpriced for the size you receive which is why I give it a 4/5.
5 stars,"Drinkable desserts parlay from Taiwan.  The golden ratio of their proprietary brown sugar syrup, organic milk, and blend of slow-cooked tapioca pearls makes the best boba tea in town, if not the world.  The larger boba is very chewy and …"
4 stars,"Tiger Sugar is known for their brown sugar milk teas. This location is always crowded because they are located in the heart of food district in Rowland Heights. The cup size is a bit small for Large size, they do offer XLarge but the …"
4 stars,"Been here twice already and my go-to order is their black sugar boba tea latte.

VALUE
Not gonna lie, it’s pretty darn pricey. $5.75 for my drink pictured. Personally I think it’s a bit overpriced.

TASTE
Disregarding price, the boba and drink from this place is top tier. Really chewy boba and loved the tea latte. I think the tea is essential. Without it, I’d just be drinking milk and sugar.

WOULD I COME BACK
I would definitely come back again if my friends wanted to go. I would not go on my own."
2 stars,"I visited last week during the day and ordered the no. 1 Tiger Sugar Boba Milk with Cream mousse. The experience was underwhelming. There was no wait- I was first in line with no one behind me, just to others waiting outside for their …"
1 star,"Drink were not that good, #1 is most famous. Got diarrhea, milk was bad. Won't be coming back.all hype. Parking is limited."
3 stars,"Ordered a brown sugar boba milk with soy milk, regular sweetness. About $6 for a 16oz cup, which is expensive. Sugar milk was a little bland, tasted around 50-75% sweet compared to most boba shops. Boba was soft but didn’t have much taste.

7/10"
3 stars,"Open til 10pm, pretty nice. Serving is fast.
Overall is not bad
But the brown sugar tastes too strong and sweet after few sips."
5 stars,"The drink here is made with organic milk, heavy cream and small boba..The texture and quality of the end product is in of itself a unique experience. You will not regret choosing #5 on the Menu."
2 stars,Black sugar boba oolong latte was very watery and didn't have much flavor
5 stars,It’s finally here! The boba is so fresh and dark sugar is super tasty. Definitely the best boba in town!
3 stars,"Not bad not too sweet, the boba is a bit over-cooked for me, and 1/3 is all ice, with the price you're paying,  the drink should be larger."
5 stars,"The drink tasted so fresh and good, not too sweet... highly recommend..yum"
4 stars,"I've been here a couple of times when they first opened up and just recently came back when I heard about their collaboration with Hello Kitty. The little girl in me could not resist and knew that I had to find a way to get my hands on their cupholders. Four hours into the opening day, the majority of the cupholders and plushies were already sold out. They still had the brown colored bow cupholder when it was my time to order. Since I've been here a couple times, their boba has always been generally pretty solid, perfectly chewy and bouncy. Maybe because it was the Hello Kitty collab and there was just so much demand, but the boba texture was definitely disappointing. It felt like it needed to be cooked more or simmered a bit longer before it was served. I did get to try their Hello Kitty drink which was essentially a strawberry milk with boba drink and it was pretty tasty but definitely for those with sweet tooths. I did like how they added dried strawberries on top.

Parking was a little challenging at the time because they only have a couple of spots in their lot. Although Walgreens is right next to it, they have a sign that says the parking spaces are specifically for Walgreens customers. I did find that there was another parking lot next to it that didn't seem to have those enforcements. You can also park on the huge lot on Batson Ave. and Colima Rd. and just walk over to Tiger Sugar, which is what we did."
4 stars,"Great place, great drinks small parking, no sit down only to go. The are quick service, you come get your drink and leave. Perfect for what it is"
3 stars,Came here to get the Hello Kitty X Tiger Sugar drikk holders but they were sold out. This is a small to go boba shop with 2 outdoor tables for seating. Service was good and fast. The drink had too much ice so we felt ripped off but it tasted fine. Hello Kitty goods to be back in stock in a few weeks according to the workers.
1 star,"Boba was soggy, overcooked, and bland. Slow service. I only had one drink, but the cashier took 6 people's orders with multiple drinks after me, and made everyone's drinks at the same time instead of just making my 1 drink first. Other people had more than 1 drink."
5 stars,"Finally, I got the chance to try Tiger Sugar! I've heard good things about it and am glad I tried it today. I see why this is one of the best brown sugar milk teas around! The milk tea was silky and smooth, and the brown sugar mixed in was perfect. The brown sugar is warm at the bottom when the drink is served, which is really nice, as it really goes well with the milk tea. In other places I've tried it, brown sugar is not as warm. I also liked how the drink was not super-sweet to the point of making you feel a little sick. Definitely recommended!"
4 stars,"IG@daysoffwithray
Got it for thr hype! It's pretty good. Only 4 stars cuz I'm more of a fruity boba kinda guy"
1 star,"My boyfriend and I ordered the large strawberry green tea with boba and the brown sugar boba with cream. I was disappointed already because I went here just for the fact that they had cheese foam on the menu. When we got there, multiple toppings or menu items were unavailable. My drink had mushy boba and the green tea was very bitter tasting. My boyfriend’s drink was extremely sweet and the boba tasted burnt."
3 stars,I went there to purchase a gift card for a friend who turned me on to this place . There were no advertisements to say they did or didn't and when I asked the CASHIER she didn't know . She did call a big dude out from the back and he knew how. Got a gift card emailed to me and I put it in my own Christmas card. 🎄 I was very surprised that they didn't have squat on the counter about any thing like that ! They could have made more sales !
3 stars,"The green tea is sweetened nicely and the cup has a cool asthetic labeling, perfect place to take a snap and enjoy."
5 stars,I had an amazing experience today. My first time visiting this location and I could tell you that I was welcomed and the barista was patient enough to recommend a good coffee boba tea that I was looking for. I set at the outside tables and the owner was kind enough to take time to genuinely get to know me plus offered a good tea! I could only rate 5 stars or else I would have rated 10/10!
5 stars,My favorite boba spot! I like the flavors and the fact that they have the tiny pearl boba. Everyone is really nice here and the service is quick. I always get #1 but I need to try more stuff off their menu.
5 stars,"Wow, hands-down, this is The Best Tasting Milk Boba I've ever had. Love it, hooked. Hope they will soon expand to Inland Empire."
5 stars,There are so many options! And they were so nice to answer all my questions and explain what drinks and variations they had and were super fast! I like that we can adjust sweetness cuz I don’t like it too sweet.
4 stars,Seen that place is busy all the time. I was tried black sugar Boba milk. Tested very good
4 stars,Love this place. Always go with the brown sugar milk tea with white mousse. Beware: Make sure to mix very well!
3 stars,The quality of the boba isn't to my expectations. It isn't worth the hype but you can give it a try.
5 stars,Went here bcos of the hype back in Singapore and Indonesia (i didn't get the chance to try it). Their boba is definitely one of the best I've ever tried. It's more on the sweet side but it's just right. The caramelized sugar was legit! Boba is soft and chewy. My husband got one with the pearl and it was even better. They limit the number of customer in store for social distancing purpose. I only wish the cup was bigger and the location was nearer. It was a long drive from west LA. 😂
5 stars,Best Boba that I have ever had!  Now I understand why there are always so many people here waiting for their order.
4 stars,Came here for the Hello Kitty x Tiger Sugar collab but when I reached the registered we were limited to a single cup holder per customer when i've seen people walking away with 2 during release day. Atmosphere and staff were okay. Boba could be better. I walked away a bit disappointed and not as satisfied after paying $20.
4 stars,"Boba tea with cream, #1 on menu is good.   Boba is chewy and drink is flavorful. Pricey but worth it. Service is good and store was empty when I went. Small store,  feel cramp."
3 stars,"For their price, its ok.  Their boba are not the best but just average.  As for the staffs & service, it's hit or miss."
5 stars,"José is the man! Great customer service and got our drinks fast! Gave us great recommendations for our first time, we will be back!"
2 stars,Was really excited to come back after not having Tiger Sugar for a couple years and it is not what I remembered it to be :(
3 stars,The drink itself was good was disappointed with the boba though. We visited because of all the hype on Ig but in my opinion I've had better.
4 stars,I absolutely love Tiger Sugar been coming here for about 2 years now. My top favorites here are Milo and A4 drink with coffee jelly. Their brown sugar boba has always been fresh and soft and chewy but lately the quality of their boba has been declining. I am happy they introduce a large cup size option for these drinks. 🧋 …
1 star,I know it is the opening day.   Got here at 12NOON. They open at 1230.  It is currently 215PM. Not inside yet.  They are aware that there is a long line every time they open a new branch.  The least they can do is place shade on the long waiting area.  Those sunshades/tent are easily business expense. Have a staff member update the long line of people of what is happening and offer water for the people who has been in the line for more than 2 hours with a 90 degree weather. Not even a festive music even to celebrate the opening of this new place.   1 Star for how they treat their new customers.  The drinks better be good or else I won’t be back.  Check out the video I posted.
5 stars,"Well worth the wait, Authentic boba milk tea, must try!"
4 stars,"We went on a Sunday afternoon, the line was not super long. We waited about 25 minutes but it could be because it was raining so the line was not ridiculously long. We ordered 2 #1 and they were really good. The boba was fresh and perfectly done. The drinks were on the sweet side but not too sweet. It was probably the best boba milk tea I have had in the greater LA area."
4 stars,"Good boba place. We ordered the first 3 top drinks there. Like its name, the drinks have strong brown sugar flavor so if you like the brown sugar flavor, it's a great choice for you to try."
5 stars,Friendly and accommodating staff. Great boba. Awesome place for a sweet treat on a hot day.
3 stars,"Milk tea is decent, kinda tasted like cereal milk.. the tapioca pearls are small in size and they give you a large straw I didn't like that. I got Black Sugar Milk Boba it's also on the smaller size. The cashier who took my order was short seemed kinda bothered. If it's busy there is a line outside and one person inside the store at a time."
3 stars,"They deliver average service with average boba tea. Nothing special. Limited boba menu. The quality is good, but like others have mentioned they use too much ice. I’d rather pay more money and get a cup of boba with less ice and more tea. The staff is immature and not professional at all, BUT it doesn’t affect the quality of the tea here. There’s tons of other shops in the area that are much better, however Tiger Sugar is one of those things that has a certain taste."
3 stars,"I love Milk Tea Boba, and this place has good flavor. Is it the best? I say no, but definitely towards the better tasting ones.

I don't understand the hype since you can get similar tasting milk tea in other places as well.

One thing that irks me about this place is they fill the cup with 85% ice and the rest milk tea. Take 5 big gulps and it's gone.

I hate it when I finish the drink before getting to all the Boba. It happens all the time with this place. 3 stars is a very honest rating for the overall place. Milk tea taste, 4 stars."
5 stars,Number 1 was good. The Boba was perfectly qq (chewy)
2 stars,"Great drinks and great boba, customer service isn’t the best. They’re quite snarky.

I cant have a drink with extra boba or light or no ice that I’ll gladly PAY for. “No adjustments”, really silly because the entire cup is ice and only two sips of the actual drink."
5 stars,Love it. Ask for less boba if you don't like it too sweet.
2 stars,"Generally speaking, the boba is good, but it would be awesome if the workers could be less arrogant during the morning shifts. I'm just here to buy a drink please. Sincerely wish you can start the day off happier and improve the quality of customer service!"
5 stars,I loved the Black Sugar Boba Milk with Cream Mousse. It was absolutely delicious & not that sweet. Some of the best boba I've had. I bought the large size & finished it before I even got home.
5 stars,"Despite being its first day and grand opening, I thought the staff was still friendly and the quality was great.

Certainly tasted like the ones I had in the Philippines. Their brown sugar boba milk with cream mousse is uncanny, there is nothing like it no matter how hard other tea shops try to imitate their recipe.

For all the haters who complained about waiting in the hot sun for nearly 3 hrs... that’s obviously  on you for making that choice and not being prepared. That’s not the shops fault that everyone decided to go on opening day. They take their time on quality, so I’m okay with that and people should be more mindful of that."
5 stars,So good the brown sugar drink is bomb they have all different types of boba. It's beautiful & tasty! The parking is easy right next to Wallgreens but in a good location. Staff is super friendly and the inside is clean and modern!
5 stars,"This is the best Boba place around. Whenever we're anywhere near Vegas or LA, we make sure to hit up Tiger Sugar"
5 stars,"I always like stopping by here when I have to go to Rowland heights, their black sugar boba milk tea and their boba milk latte are always good!"
5 stars,"Love it!! Well balance on the sweetness, creamy and chewy boba. I order #1 and my wife order their black tea latte. Line move pretty fast, 12-15 ppl in front of me and took about 10 mins. Just waiting on the drinks took a bit longer than I expect. But overall good quality beverage!!"
2 stars,"Okay the drinks are pretty good but one staff docks the star down. The store is pretty loud so we hardly hear her call our order number so she screams out impolitely. When we come to pick up our order, she looks askance at us. I understand you’re busy but at least be polite"
4 stars,"OMG! Finally Tiger Sugar launches in LA. Even though I neither try the one in Taiwan nor New York, I heard Tiger Sugar in the recent year. So my review is most likely based on my taste buds. The boba is different from what I have tasted before. Its taste and texture are very unique. It is very chewy and with brown sugar caramel taste. The drink itself is not too sweet but the brown sugar caramel smell and taste are full of the drink. I can tell it is with quality. The last but not least, the milk in the drink is with quality as well according to the taste and texture. Based on the characters of the boba, the milk and the sugar, the drink is unique and high quality that should be impressive enough at the price of around 4-5 dollars. I would give this store 4 stars that I do believe there is always room to improve especially the wait time."
5 stars,"drinks are one size, grab the boba milk tea and it's about $6 per cup. no modifications allowed.

granted the line wasn't too long, i thought it wasn't too bad. i came in and out in 5 minutes. i thought that this boba was one of the most unique tasting drink i ever had, it was really, really good. something about it had the same body as oat milk but i'm not sure what kind of cream they use. i'm so sad that this isn't any closer to my place as i'd love to stop by and get this daily. don't let the bad reviews discourage you."
5 stars,I have not been impressed by Brown Sugar Boba or Tiger Sugar Boba at any other place but this place! The smoothest tasting version of this Boba flavor. They add a cream that gives it a distinct flavor and silky taste. I'd highly recommend and it definitely lives up the hype !
5 stars,I'm usually more of a coffee guy than boba but I love what Tiger Sugar does to their drink. Everything is done meticulously and it shows through its presentation and taste. I've noticed them in Asia in my past few times back but there were always a long line. I was excited when I found out they were opening one hear just a short drive away. I avoided the crowded initially but have since gone a few times during off hours in the late afternoon. Now it is a treat for my kids and DW as well. I heard that they will start having coffee soon. I'll be looking forward.
4 stars,"This place is a delicious treat. A bit expensive about 5.20 plus tax for a cup about the size of a small drink McDonalds, but definetely a treat the Milk is excellent quality and Boba/Pearls were perfectly cooked. Minus one star for the price, but other than that absolutely delicious. Definetely worth a try if you havent had a chance."
4 stars,"Not for tea!!

I ordered a brown sugar boba black milk tea. The boba tasted good but the tea was weak…  I think this place would be great for someone who is not looking to get milk tea.
But the service was nice and fast!!"
2 stars,"One if the worst Grand opening events I've ever attended. We arrived at 12:30pm. Line was already wrapped past the building.  At 2:00 they started taking down the umbrellas, chairs, and water. Taking away the already small amount of shade the line had. We got the number 5 and 3. Drinks were ok, kind of expensive for the size,$5.25 each for our drinks. Not worth the 3hr wait for a free tote bag. Oh and when we got to the register we were told they were out of boba. It was only 3:30 and they opened at 12:30...😑😑😑"
1 star,"😪This is Bad. Listen up - there is a reason you cannot Customize your drink here. Why? Because You are paying for ICE! ICE! baby! More than half your cup will be filled with ICE! LOL. Cheap drink. Overrated nonsense.
Instead of this place, check out - 7 Leaves cafe boba teas/coffee! Amazing quality drinks there. Also check out ShareTea! (Oh and they customize their drinks the way you like it!) 😀"
3 stars,"I got 0% sugar and maybe that's why it didn't taste that great but other places warn you if that's the case..... it kinda just tasted like milk and even then the milk was not mixing well and you could see specks of milk clumps, sorry I don't know how to say it in English. It is definitely not worth the price"
5 stars,Probably one of the best I've ever had
1 star,"We arrived to the store at 1:15pm and proceeded to stand in line for 2.5 hours in the hot sun. We eventually got into the store and ordered our four drinks at 3:43pm. I asked to speak to a manager. I ended up talking to a guy named Chi. I told him it was completely unacceptable that on their grand opening that patrons were forced to stand in line for 2.5 hours without any water or shade. Chi stood there, nodded, and smiled like a psychopath while I told him how unacceptable this entire situation was. I asked what he was going to do about it and he replied, ""Let me think about it."" WHAT THE HECK ANSWER IS THAT? Later, he said he would send me a gift certificate via email-- I will be VERY surprised if he follows through on that. I also interacted with a second manager Kent who at least was very apologetic. He said he was really sorry about the situation and talked about how this was their first day, etc. I told him that people understand when things go wrong or are slow on a first day, but it's completely unacceptable to leave your patrons outside standing in a two hour line without any water or even acknowledgement. The least he could do is hand out water to them and explain what's going on or INTERACT with the patrons who are so excited to come to his store. He did end up buying a bunch of water and handing it out to people, but it was 2.5 hours too late. Hopefully nobody got hurt or too dehydrated from this experience.

Here's a list of things that I observed that the store could improve on.
1. It was 90 degrees and sunny. People were picking up cardboard boxes out of the trash to use it to shield themselves from the sun. UNACCEPTABLE! The staff should have been handing out water to the patrons who were standing in line or gotten some umbrellas. After my angry diatribe, I saw that waters were being handed out which was a good change, but it was still way too late
2. The line was extremely disorganized, the staff should have had some people outside working the line and interacting with the patients. The line went through the store, around the store, and then in the very back of the store. They should really have had someone standing there helping with line management, especially since there were cars going back and forth in the back. It would have been very bad if someone got hurt.
3. After about an hour of waiting, I saw some people rushing into the store with bags of ice-- looks like they ran out of ice on their first day. Unbelievable for a beverage store.
4. In 2.5 hours, they ran out of boba. Who runs out of boba at a bubble tea store AND on the grand opening day???
5. I counted 10 people behind the counter ""making drinks"". Why were there 10 people behind the counter to make beverages? And each of them were doing one task which was extremely weird. I think I saw one person 'weighing' the boba/pearls. That seems very inefficient. Get a spoon or cup that's the right size, you don't have time to weigh things.
6. One of the four drinks we ordered ended up having a few stray milk pearls, which was also weird.

Overall, this was a terrible experience and I would not recommend anyone to go. There are several bubble tea/boba restaurants within a one mile radius of this place. Honestly, if I hadn't been with a friend who was super excited to try this place, I would have left after half an hour."
2 stars,"The line was long, the place was very small and you CANNOT customize any drink. It is very over hyped and it tastes like the one you order at 85 degrees, the difference is the one for 85 degrees is more affordable and it has more flavor.  Would not recommend it."
4 stars,"The line was ridiculously long and took about half an hour for me to get my drink. It tasted good, but they need a more efficient way of getting people in and out of this plaza. Parking lot is too small for the large volume of customers"
2 stars,"Hilariously bad grand opening.

I enjoyed watching the world (and people) literally burn in the sun in our 2.8H waits from end of line to product in hand. Folks were using umbrellas, sweaters, blankets and even cardboard boxes to limit their exposure.

There were umbrellas outside-- but they were taken down at 2PM, just in time for peak heat at 3PM to really let everyone bake.

I was able to see management get blasted by angry customers and I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.

After getting blasted by the complaints, management started passing water out.

Tiger Sugar ran out of boba and asked me to substitute another item on their menu.

I do not believe the people waiting in line were made aware of the boba outage."
5 stars,Loved this place wish we had one in Minnesota! Me and my friends came here to check it out and they gave us a free bag of their caramel popcorn when they found out how far we had traveled ❤️ Great boba tea too!
3 stars,Drinks are fairly good. They have primarily caramelized sugar drinks with a cream mousse. Staff is not great and could use improvement in CSR. Plenty of other shops with knowledgeable and friendly staff.
5 stars,Sarah provides excellent service!! She makes a mean Thai Tea Latte too…
4 stars,Been to this place a couple times. Would go more of they didn't have a line all the time. Their signature tiger milk tea is awesome. Boba is hit or miss though.
5 stars,So delicious!! Employees are super friendly and the black sugar with pudding boba is so yummy! My favorite new boba spot
5 stars,Brown sugar milk and boba was best I had and went around 9:30 pm . Fresh and tasty were I craved the brown sugar milk. Staff is a 10
4 stars,The place is great if you're into drinks that aren't sugar bombs. The one downside is the price for the quantity given. It's definitely still worth a trip.
1 star,"I've been here four+ times to order drinks and use the restroom and every time, while there are FOUR to SIX employees working here at the time, they always say(and have a sign that says), the restroom is OUT OF ORDER. This is extremely inhumane working conditions for over two years now. Get the restroom/s fixed for THEIR sakes."
3 stars,What's the rave about? It's another basic boba place that tastes just like all the others. The drink is mediocre and tastes just like bland sugared milk.
5 stars,"Delicious boba and sugar is free in all drinks. If diabetic this might be a place of heaven but beware, too much tiger sugar can be bad for you."
3 stars,Went there and somewhat crowded but not bad.  Different  and could have been better.  Not really clean using same towel to wipe cup of tea down and then counter.  Cv19 era so need different practices.
4 stars,Tiger sugar is not like any other boba place they have their own unique style and flavor of milk tea and coffee lattes.
5 stars,"Friendly staff, the dude know his stuff.
I got the #1 with oat milk."
5 stars,Best bobba ive ever drink! Sadly its too far. U guys need more locations in LA!
5 stars,Best boba in West Covina
5 stars,"OMG! I think i might become addicted to this place. Had 1 drink, finished and felt sad that there wasn't more... definitely getting 2 next time. Amazing flavor!"
5 stars,I actually liked it! As a guy not really into boba drinks but it's actually good. I had #6
5 stars,Some of the best milk tea and boba I've had! Usually a bit of a wait but definitely worth it!
4 stars,First time being there. Love the drink. Especially the Black Sugar Boba Milk Cream Mousse. It was good.
4 stars,Not too sweet and the boba is GOOD. The only downside is that this place is pricey compared with other brands of boba 😂 …
4 stars,Yummy-)) Classic Brown sugar milk tea boba
4 stars,"Great staff, boba is ok, kind of too chewy, however the milk tea is delicious"
2 stars,Ordered #3 and #12. Overhyped. Drinks are nothing special. Boba has good consistency.
5 stars,Very tasty desert drinks. I ordered b2 the creme Brule. Lots of flavor very good. Drink it cold
2 stars,"Too much ice in the drink, infect more than half of the cup was ice. Very small cup for $5.25. So not worth it. Do NOT recommend"
4 stars,I order their popular drink which is number 1 and the milk drink is rich and creamy but the boba is on the bland side(compare to half & half).
4 stars,Slightly overpriced but it's a solid place for drinks and the mini boba was very soft to bite through
5 stars,Amazing. They specialize in brown sugar milk teas and they do it so well. I get the number 7 but the 6 is just as good.
3 stars,"This place is pretty overall rated, its just milk and their Boba taste is above average."
5 stars,They have Oatly Oat Milk! No extra cost. We did not have to wait in any line and the service was very friendly and quick!
5 stars,Milk drinks are delicious. I really like their black tea. Tastes like a sweet tea that you can taste the tea in.
1 star,"When you ask for NO ICE they refuse, and day it's part of the receipe.  How can Ice be part of a receipe? Ice is used to keep things cold, so they're trying to burn people for 6 bucks.."
5 stars,Love coming here when I get a chance. There was no line when I went on a Saturday afternoon. I always ask for 70% sugar and less ice.
5 stars,"So delicious!!!
Recommended"
5 stars,The boba quality and texture is really good. The line can sometimes be long but it moved quickly.
5 stars,Omg Love Love this place best drinks ever all I have to say is this will be my first choice and Starbucks second....
5 stars,"Recommend the black sugar boba and pudding! The pudding tastes like Vietnamese flan, very good!"
1 star,"This company steals art and uses it towards its own marketing without crediting the artists, all while continually whining on its own social media pages about knockoffs of their own brand. Shady."
3 stars,"Over priced for alot of ice, Boba and small amount of fluid. Overall the drink was decent."
1 star,"Something changed from when the place first opened.  Dunno what happened.
Maybe in with the new shops and outdated with the old shops?"
5 stars,"Love their boba milk tea,ice cream and popcorn, try it all and you'l fall in love with all of it."
5 stars,The brown sugar made the boba tea taste super unique. Will come back in the future.
5 stars,This was probably one of the best milk teas ive ever had it was so scrumdidlyumptious 5/5 would reccomend
1 star,"If you have questions, be ready to drive to location and ask them because they can't answer their phones."
1 star,"Small cups, I ask light ice, but when I finished drink, more than half cups ice still there! They charged $5.65 after taxes, how come we spend money for lot of ice?!"
5 stars,"If you love boba drinks, then this is the place you have to go and try..."
4 stars,Drink was really good. The only thing is the parking and no seating in or around the store...shame...

5 stars,"Brown sugar Boba milk tea, full of Taiwanese flavor (⁎⁍̴̛ᴗ⁍̴̛⁎)ᵍᵒᵒᵈ"
4 stars,"It was small but cozy. Perhaps because we went during the day, there weren't many customers."
1 star,"I went there today before it opened at 12 o'clock. After queuing for half an hour, I was finally able to order. The reasons for negative reviews are as follows:
1. All the drinks listed on the menu can be made into hot drinks, but the ordering guy said that 1-7 are not available.
2. I ordered No. 10 green tea. The instructions and the note may indicate no ice, but what I got was still ice.
3. When I got home half an hour later, my wife couldn't drink cold drinks, so she took out the ice, but it was half the amount. That means half of the money you paid was ice for you."
3 stars,"Bad attitude. No cash, No plastic bags, you can't ask for no ice, and you can't ask for more pearl.
No cash, no plastic bags, no ice, no pearls. The attitude is rather bad. The portion is still small, but there is still a lot of ice.
Why don't I go to Yifang?"
1 star,The cashier lady used the excuse that she didn't know Chinese to make a bad face at people who spoke Chinese. It was disgusting! Most of your guests are Chinese. Is this appropriate?
5 stars,"The pinnacle of brown sugar hanging on the wall, the pearls are more delicious than the boba, and the pudding tastes good too"
5 stars,"I don't like sweet and greasy things, but it's so delicious that I go to this place whenever I feel like it. It's far away and there's always a line, so I can't help but go."
1 star,"The service attitude is very poor, especially the person responsible for placing orders"
5 stars,"First experience, the boba tastes good when you open the door."
