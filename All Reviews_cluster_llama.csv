5,"Absolutely love this place! Tiger Sugar never disappoints‚Äîthe boba is always fresh, and signature drinks are rich, creamy, and perfectly balanced in sweetened. Must try it!!!
The staff is incredibly friendly and efficient! If you‚Äôre a boba lover, this is definitely a spot worth visiting.",0
5,"Best boba in Colorado hands down.

We got a lychee boba and their number 1 black sugar boba. It was excellent. We got XL you have to go with XL.

Perfect sweetness, the owner was amazing. Took the time to explain and made sure we ordered what we wanted and recommended perfectly she was also amazingly friendly! :))

Every time I am in Westminster, I will stop by to get my boba fix.

Thank you üôè",0
5,"Tiger Sugar‚Äôs boba teas are very different from your regular boba. It‚Äôs definitely more innovative, rich and delicious. It also has yummy snacks like the fish balls. Highly recommend!",0
5,"Absolutely amazing bubble tea! TIGER SUGAR never disappoints. Their signature brown sugar boba is next level‚Äîrich, creamy, and perfectly balanced in sweetness. The boba pearls are soft, chewy, and infused with that delicious caramelized flavor. You can tell they use high-quality ingredients, and the presentation is always beautiful with that signature tiger stripe effect!

The staff is super friendly and efficient, even when there's a long line (which is totally worth the wait!). If you're a bubble tea lover, this place is a must-try. Highly recommend the Brown Sugar Boba Milk with Cream Mousse‚Äîit's a game changer! Will definitely be coming back for more! üßã",0
5,"Great taste! So glad that there‚Äôs an affordable proper boba place in northern Denver suburb. Will come back again for other drinks. Just a little disappointed at the giant boba, which doesn‚Äôt have the consistency of the typical tapioca boba but more like coffee jelly.",0
1,Hands down the worst boba drinks in history that ive tried. I tried almost every local boba place if not all of them and none of them were this bad. We bought a total of 7 drinks some of them not pictured since my friends was eager to get it and go home but all of us have about the same complaint which was it was bland it just tasted like milk and water with little to no tea flavor at all and for sure no sweetness existed. I bought the 6 A drink which was brown sugar with mochi and boba and i can tell you that was the worst drink ever which had the consistency of spoiled milk so it did not pair well with the drink at all and the drink not having any flavor to it did not help it one bit. All my friends who ordered the drink said their drinks were quite flavorless and no sweetness. If i could rate it lower than a 1 star i would. Definitely never coming here again as well as let others know how bad it is here.,0
5,Me and my 2 teens Love this place especially the black sugar boba it's nice and chewey not hard and their baked goods are fabulous love everything üòçü§©‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä ‚Ä¶,0
5,"So excited to have a tiger sugar up here finally! Service was very fast and there was no line when we came in thankfully. We got the pudding and coffee ones which were SO good. the staff here is friendly and fast. The parking situation is weird and the location is super tiny with very minimal seating but other than that, I can't complain!",0
5,I‚Äôm so happy they opened a location in my neighborhood! I was here for opening day and they gave out freebies for the first 100 customers like they mentioned on Facebook. Love their original tiger drink. I‚Äôll be coming back to try their other drinks!,0
4,"Really delicious and unique Boba! My only complaint is that the ice ratio is extremely high; I was out of tea really quickly. Would recommend asking for a little less ice in your drink, unless you're really into that sort of thing. Otherwise, very tasty! The giant Boba is delicious and has a great texture too.",0
2,"I've been to several different boba shops and felt confident in going to a good shop with the 4.3 stars on Google. I had seen the giant boba advertised on Instagram so I came and it was not what I was expecting at all. The other reviews are correct, you can't customize your drinks, what the pictures look like is what you get.

The main problem I had was the boba balls in the giant boba drink are not the typical tapioca boba, but have the consistency of Jello and taste more chemically than brown sugary. While the drink itself was okay, I was really disappointed with the quality of the boba. I couldn't finish the drink which does not happen often for me, the boba was just too gross.

The atmosphere of the store is more of a grab your drink and go place, instead of games and a hangout spot. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's also not the most inviting. It was very clean though which I appreciated. The service was great, no trouble at all and the lady was fast and very nice. She was definitely the best part of my experience at TIGER SUGER Westminster.

With not being able to customize my drink and the lack of quality in the beverage, I most likely will not be back.",0
2,Much better boba options in the area. I love Tiger Sugar but this location is not great. The other low reviews are accurate and you cannot customize your drinks in any way. They are also not the most friendly staff we‚Äôve seen (could just have been unlucky). We‚Äôve been several times to give it a chance but probably won‚Äôt be back.,0
1,Heard really good things about Tiger Sugar was very underwhelmed. The barista seemed like she didn't know what she was doing. The taro drink tasted just like milk with old boba in it üôÑ and the matcha was bland and also very underwhelming. Very disappointed and the drinks were like $7 a piece.,0
4,"My girls and I love the Jumbo boba. Service was good. The atmosphere for where it is, is okay. Just got cramped fast when other people where waiting for drinks as well. Really good overall!!",0
5,"Clean, friendly staff. Great Bubble teas! Must try.",1
5,First time I got there. The service was really fast. Clean and warm . My drink soooo delicious. I was love it. I will come again soon!,0
5,"Drinks are great, snacks are even better. People who leave 1 stars do not know what asian boba drinks taste like, its an acquired taste, dont blame the store if you dont like the taste, its your fault not the drinks.",0
5,My grandma went in Tuesday afternoon. She has no idea what boba is and the girl in the front stood there for 15 minutes helping her and explaining to her about every drink she was questioning while also helping other customers. She finally decided on the Mango Sago and ordered me their signature. Absolutely amazing service and the loveliest staff. You have to try their drinks. My new go to drink place!! The place itself is very cozy.,0
1,"The boba at this place was absolutely heinous. There was like 8 different textures and no room for customization. I got the Taro one and it was absolutely terrible. It was curdly and weirdly chunky, utter lack of flavor and overall just a terrible drink. I will never be buying a drink from Tiger Sugar again :) don‚Äôt waste ur money here",0
2,"Got two drinks for me and my daughter, I got the taro boba (bc they were out of the hello kitty drink) & my daughter got the strawberry mochi

The taro pudding boba had the consistency of milk that was rotten. It didn‚Äôt taste sweet it 100% tasted like it shouldn‚Äôt have with hard flavorless chunks in it . Didn‚Äôt get to try a drink of it until we already left.. the hype wasn‚Äôt worth it",0
1,If I could give a 0 I would. Came in because I saw a TikTok ad for their giant boba tea drink. Went into the Westminster location and ordered two teas with jumbo Boba and saw a sign saying to shake boba before you drink it. Paid almost 16$ for 2 drinks got in the car tried to take a sip and got a drink of powdery gelatin. I shook both more than necessary and it was absolutely disgusting! Got home and tried to doctor the drink up by boiling the mixture and I tried the giant boba balls which tasted like CHEMICALS. Worst thing I ever drank and tasted! MAYBE DONT ADVERTISE DRINKS THAT ARE OVERPRICED GARBAGE! GO TO KING FU TEA INSTEAD!!,0
1,"Changed to 1 star after realizing they do this to everyone.
As tons of people have already mentioned.  They dont let you customize your drink.  Wanna add boba to a drink that doesnt have it?  They will just tell you no.  Willing to pay extra? Too bad.  They know whats best.  To the owner.  Ease dont paste your generic reply about measuring the best freshest ingredients.  Your customers want something, are willong to pay you more for it, and you tell them no?  Seems pretty stupid.  The only reviews you get that are positive is when ppl just happend to like something youve made the way it comes. I'll just go to literally ANY other place.",0
4,The service was the best part! I went in for a popcorn chicken - thats all - and it took 25m for it to be prepared. Will be back for Boba; atmosphere is small and clean.,0
5,One of the best boba‚Äôs I‚Äôve gotten. I love their Mango green tea with regular boba. It‚Äôs the perfect amount of sweetness for me and the ratio of boba to tea is perfect. If you‚Äôre in the area you have to stop by and try this place!,0
5,"The black sugar boba +pudding milk tea was so good. It was like flan and boba and milk tea in a cup. They have a lot of options and none of them seem to be things you typically find at other boba shops, so I would read the menu before you go. None of my ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù drinks were on the menu. But that led me to explore and go out of my comfort zone!",0
3,"Not enough customization. Great staff, very friendly, but the main draw of boba is being able to customize your own drink. Too many things on the menu were not changeable in any way.",0
5,PERFECT BOBA!! I‚Äôve tried tiger sugar in Aurora and it‚Äôs such a drive but when I found out we had one coming here I couldn‚Äôt wait. It was just as great as the first time. My boyfriend and I loved the number one. You guys hands down have the best boba pearls i've ever tasted too and have such a sweet staff. I cannot wait to keep coming back here.,0
5,I have tried everything they have on the menu and definitely love this boba shop. The coffee latte and Mango sago are my favorite. I also like the passion fruit tea as their newer arrival.The workers are so friendly and helpful every time I visit too.,0
1,"Ordered a brown sugar boba and a mango one and it had these weird jello pieces in it that tasted like fish. Hands down worst boba ever, do not go here. There was also a weird bug trap thing at the front of the store with dead moths in it. Absolutely disgusting",0
2,I‚Äôve never been to a boba shop that doesn‚Äôt allow you to not have ice. Which is kind of annoying because I like to buy drinks for my family members but don‚Äôt want the ice to water down the drinks. Share tea and kung fu tea allow you to customize your orders without a problem,0
5,strawberry waffle that is really good.. So like it. Is yummy,1
5,I've been to so many boba places in the Denver metro. I went for the first time to this one yesterday and it was incredible. It was definitely the freshest one I've been to. Can't wait to go back!,0
5,"I've had a fair amount of boba drinks, but this was my first experience having boba that's so creamy. It was different than what I expected, but very tasty!",0
5,"Super cute, clean shop with friendly service and amazing drinks. So excited to have found this spot, definitely worth a try for anyone who loves tea or boba.",0
5,"Brown sugar milk tea, with its perfect blend of rich milk and sweet brown sugar, is always amazingü§ç",0
5,The most delicious boba in town! Be sure to get the taro pudding milk tea and the black sugar boba and pearl w/cream mousse drinks. SO good.,0
5,This place has the best boba and wonderful customer service! ‚≠êÔ∏è,1
5,The boba here is so good. I‚Äôve only tried the Matcha so far but can‚Äôt wait to try the other flavors too. Service was fast and friendly!,0
5,The workers were so sweet and made accommodations to my drink! They suggested me a great drink and the boba was so fresh despite me coming in pretty late!,0
5,"I got the strawberry mocha on their grand opening, it‚Äôs my favorite!! Finally it came to Westminster!! I can save my 40mins driving. It‚Äôs as good as always. I got my freeeeee drink as the first 100 customers too! Yeah!",0
5,"The BEST boba in town!
Service is great as well.",1
5,I come on a nice Sunday night and tall wasian girl and Vietnamese girl make me delicious boba best boba ever taste just like my home country wasian girl Chinese very good and helpful because my English is no good üòä,0

5,"TIGER SUGAR IN WESTMINSTER?! I‚Äôm so happy!!! Best boba in Colorado. Great location. Also, the employees were so nice and lovely.",1
5,My favorite Boba place üíô ‚Ä¶,1
4,Fast and friendly service with beautiful drinks that taste great and really beat the heat! They gave us a punch card for a free drink so we will be back!,0
5,I always get the Mochi boba or the brown sugar creme brulee drink and it always hits the spot. Great place for an indulgent sweet treat.,0
2,Took 30 minutes to get my drink 1:30pm on a Thursday. Only 2 members here who are measuring each ingredient to the gram cresting the hold up. I would say give this place a month to work out these kinks because the wait is not okay.,0
5,The drinks and desserts are amazing! I love the oolong with cheese mousse and crepe cake!,0
1,I wish they had more flavors! They do so many good collabs but not good flavors ü•≤,0
5,"I at first gave this place a bad review, but I realized it was actually mine own stupidity that influenced the review and now recognize that the drink was made perfectly, and was actually an amazing drink. Highly suggest going here.",0
5,"Same great taste, but now ordering got much easier with kiosks. Available seating enhances the experience further, too.",0
5,"Me and my husband love tiger sugar, so happy they opened one closer to us, our favorite is No 1 and  No 7",0
5,Great place to enjoy some sake and sushi for a first date!,0
1,"This place sucks, they didn‚Äôt have any drinks and all the reviews were really bad and I will never come back here.",0
5,Great Boba teas. My favorite place!,1

5,"The aesthetic is very cozy and inviting!! The customer service from the people working was amazing, they explained a lot of the menu items to us and were very nice!! Best boba place I‚Äôve been to in a minute, definitely try it out! AMAZING 10/10",0
5,"Tiger sugar is the epitome of a welcoming environment. The workers and owner have a generous spirit in customer service. I love the boba, croffles, and tayaki from here! Recommended going here with friends and family!",0
5,"If you are in or near Greenwood, IN looking for delicious boba teas or milks and incredible desserts then this is a must stop. The ambiance is very warm and welcoming with plenty of seating to include lounge and couches. Owners and staff are very friendly. There is something here for everyone.",0
3,"A friend of mine had a negative experience here but I wanted to experience it firsthand and give this place a try. I liked the interior and ambiance. Service was okay. Bathrooms were clean. The teas I ordered were Thai and Classic Taro. Personally, the brown sugar overpowered the flavor because it was absent of one. Short answer is: my friend was right!",0
5,I never give reviews but i wanted to let yall know the guy working there was super friendly and kind! He made us feel welcomed and the drinks were delicious as well! I had the matcha & my boyfriend got their signature drink & the kiddo got a mango slush and we all LOVED our drinks. The place was also very clean & cozy!,0
1,"WOW, this place is slow and so expensive and imho, not worth the wait or the price. I took my son here 2 days ago, and there was a bunch of people sitting waiting for their drinks(I wish I would have noticed that)! We ordered 2 teas at 12:46PM I received my receipt via SMS. Then we waited...During our wait, the gentlemen that took our order, called out numbers for people waiting only to ask them what they wanted to substitute as they were out of something that went in their drink(this happened twice). Then when it was his turn to make my sons tea, he said, sorry but we are out of passionfruit Boba. What would you like to substitute it with?

So finally at 1:17 he called our number and we got our drinks. I got the peach tea, with popping peach BOBA, and honestly as if the wait wasn't long enough, the tea was horrible. I was so disappointed! My son told me he would rather go to the mall and get one there next time, so I guess that is what we will do.

I would avoid this place at all costs, at least until they have their staffing and ordering of products straight. Just my 2¬¢",0
5,"Very delicious, I‚Äôve always heard of this because it‚Äôs so popular in Asia and New York and other bigger cities. I‚Äôm so glad we have one here! By looking at it you would think it‚Äôs super sweet, but it‚Äôs actually not at all. Creamy and just right amount of sugar, it has a very nice black roast flavor. I would recommend this to everyone.",0
5,"I ‚Äúneed‚Äù and ‚Äúwant‚Äù to try other menu items (especially a ‚Äúcroffle‚Äù)  but I just love the Mango Sago SO much!  üòÇ

LOVE the ambience and staff!

Give ‚Äòem a try!",0
5,"From the food to the place, everything is so well done. The customer service was amazing with their greetings as soon as you come in. The decorations make me feel comfortable and welcoming with the woodsy feeling. Variety of boba and croffles to choose from, but everything has been tasty!!",0
5,tiger sugar is one of the best places to take pics with my friends. i just come when i want to relax and chill. the workers are always friendly and nice to chat with. definitely would recommend!!!,0
5,"Been there twice so far and plan on coming back!

I love that the drinks are a little less on the sweet side than most boba shops. Good texture boba",0
5,"Highly reccomend stopping in and trying this place. The decorations inside felt very sterile. Very simple but clean. The drinks are def the star of the show. I tried a mango slush, which had real mango in the bottom. I love mango and this was very tasty. My wife ordered the number 1. This was a different level. It had boba pearls and milk pearls and the drink flavor was excellent. Fantastic carmel and brown sugar flavors with coffee tones too. Can't wait to try more on the menu.",0
5,We've been here a few times now and all of the staff are so friendly and welcoming! The bobas are tasty and the snacks are yummy! Highly recommend!,0
5,I love this place! I love the atmosphere and the drinks. The workers are wonderful. Plants add a nice touch. 10/10 recommend,0
5,"The owners are so nice and understanable. The employees are trained well and the store is always so clean, smells really good, and is asthectically pleasing. Drinks are super enjoyable and the best part about the store.",0
5,My son comes every chance he gets to get the #7 Taro Pudding with black sugar boba!,1
5,They‚Äôre the best. I got pickup today for my daughter and the guy was so nice and sweet and helpful. Thank you. Thank you so much.,0
5,The employees were so nice and the boba was excellent to taste. Definitely recommend this being your new boba spot to hang out!,0
5,"If you are looking fresh soft bobas, this is the place. We tried couple of drinks, they were all great. Must try place!",0
5,New boba place‚Ä¶.I love their passion Fruit‚Ä¶. I will be back for another flavor‚Ä¶ highly recommended ‚Ä¶,0
4,New bubble tea spot on south side of Indy. The place is nice and clean and the drinks are delicious. I will go back.,0
5,Definitely happy to have a great boba shop near home. The staff is kind and helpful.,0
5,"The drinks are delicious!!! The taro black tea has real Taro! Not just powder like other places! Also many drinks came with boba,  pudding or cream foam, the price is relatively good with all the extras! But best is how good the drink taste!",0
5,Great staff Best drink I have had in a long time been twice already!,0
5,the sink was so cool and I like the matcha,1
5,"The best place for boba and drinks...coming back again for sure
service was good and owner is very friendly and aproachable",0
1,60% ice. Too much ice and not much drink. Also the XL size drink is $1 more on Doordash even if you choose pickup in store.,0
5,"They had a very good customer service, which all the workers were really nice. The service was quick and it was still one of the best drinks. The ambience and atmosphere were really beautiful. Fully recommended. P.S one of the cleanest bathrooms you‚Äôll see.",0
5,"Absolutely delicious!!! I'm new to this Boba thing,  but this place is great!!",0
5,I love their boba. The drinks are very delicious and way better than other boba places. I am glad we have Tiger Sugar in Indianapolis.,0
5,Awesome new find in south-side Indianapolis. Just north of greenwood mall. Decor inside matches perfectly to the delightful teas. They have a wide variety of drinks to choose from.,0
3,"I got the matcha drink
Pros:
I enjoyed the taste of the matcha! It didn‚Äôt have a grassy taste + the interior was pretty
Con:
-I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the tapioca boba
-The size of the cups were misleading because their L was basically a standard size (medium/regular)",0
5,"Excellent customer service. Drinks are amazing & delicious.. highly recommend.
I finally found where to get my favorite boba drinks..",0
1,"Although the service and atmosphere was good, the boba did not taste good for the price. I feel as though you can get a better boba somewhere else for the same price.",0
2,The owner was trash talking another local teahouse IN FRONT of their employees just to promote his own business. I believe that your products should be able to stand on their own legs if they're truly good. It left a sour taste in my mouth.,0
5,Love all they have to offer. They have board games and great music. Perfect for small hangout or date. Wish more people knew about this place.,0
1,The boba didn‚Äôt taste good at all and workers there were really outgoing and greedy. Overall this was not a good boba shop to go to,0
5,Opening day at Tiger Sugar! It‚Äôs busy but the atmosphere was great. People were friendly. The F3 is amazing. You have to try them!,0
5,Loving these new fancy Boba places. Good drinks and positive vibes.,0
1,"They charged my credit card twice, and ignore my message to request a refund. Be careful when you shop here.",0
5,Great boba spot. I personally love the strawberry mochi,0
5,"The customer service is nice. I was greeted immediately when I first walked in. I ordered 5 different drinks, and it came out super quick.",0
5,Great service. The owner is really nice and friendly. The drinks are so yummy. Highly recommended.,0
1,The boba taste super bad I wouldn‚Äôt recommend but the decor and the employees were very sweet and nice,0
5,This place is a new boba in town and not only it‚Äôs new it‚Äôs the best boba place in town. You don‚Äôt want to miss it!!! Go and stop by.,0
5,"Nice customer service, very clean, and the boba is 10/10 definitely will come back!",0

5,My all time favorite boba place! The drinks never disappoint and everyone is super nice.,0
5,BEST DUMB EVERRRR NO üß¢ ‚Ä¶,1
3,"i cant lie and say i wasnt disappointed when i ordered the same thing here as i did in another branch... that might have been in another country, and received something completely different. it was still okay, but my expectations were shut down so quickly üòî have a look at my other tiger sugar review in montreal and you'll witness true greatness epitomised in a bubble tea beverage

the staff here were really nice at least!",0
4,This is the Little Tokyo outlet of Tiger Sugar bubble tea chain. You get to order with a person here as opposed to using a touch screen at some other places. Selection is quite good and they emphasize the variety of sugars and syrups. It is a good choice for Little Tokyo. Of course here you have to use paid parking to enjoy Little Tokyo.,0
4,"Tried their matcha latte and the strawberry mochi drink, the first was honestly mid but the mochi drink was sweet but good! i would say skip the lattes and go for an specialty drink which is their strongest things on the menu as well seasonal drinks if you have a sweet tooth, there‚Äôs a few tables inside for people to sit down.",0
2,"The wait wasn't too bad when I got here on a Friday afternoon. It didn't take too long to get my order either.

The tea was more on the bitter and less sugar side; not quite for me. The boba in the Black Sugar boba milk was pretty mushy and it tasted like it was sitting for too long during the cooking process.",0
4,"Drink markets in Little Tokyo is getting more competitive and another boba store just opened.

We got black sugar boba cream and mango sago drinks, oops forgot to order half sweet and it was a little too sweet.

No complain on quality of drinks.
I don‚Äôt think they are not the best in this area. Definitely best black sugar taste, but you don‚Äôt get many choices besides black sugar.
Boba was a little too firm too.

Mango drink was too thick and sweet for me, the topping was weird (is it pear?), half sweet maybe better.",0
5,"I got the boba black tea with mochi. It was really good. The owner was around and he's super attentive and made sure you were taken care of. The customer service is really good here. It's a small spot, so not that much room for studying, but I'll definitely pass by anytime I'm in Little Tokyo",0
5,"I went in to chat about a job and everyone in the store was so kind. I was offered a drink on the house while I waited, and it was so refreshing. The tea was slightly watery, but otherwise very tasty.

All of the staff were great and took the time to welcome me in and speak with me. The inside of the shop was cozy, and has a great view of the hustle and bustle of Little Tokyo.",0
5,"The heaven of all things boba! If you already know, you've told your friends. The Thai Tea was perfect!",0
5,Owner of this location was hospitable. Provided my friends with sample items for taste testing before we ordered. Boba had good consistency. Milk substitutes available for those who don't want whole milk.,0
4,"I ordered 3 drinks yesterday and 2 of them were very good! The third one was their brown sugar bubble milk tea, and it was extremely disappointing because it tasted completely like milk and nothing like tea or any other brown sugar drink I've ever tasted. Would definitely recommend people to order other drinks than that one.",0
5,"Dangerously delicious and addicting. My first try and I got the #3 ""Black Sugar Boba and Pearl Milk Cream Mousse."" Make sure you shake it many times so it mixes well!",0
2,"Service was pretty bad. I've had Tiger Sugar in Malaysia all the time, and they taste amazing. Somehow, the branch here in Little Tokyo had bland black sugar cheese mousse bubble tea. I dont know how bubble tea could even taste bland with so much sugar. Might be because they were about to close or prepped the order wrong, will not revisit.",0
2,"Beware, the prices here are higher than the prices on the menu. Literally scamming you. I asked the lady on register if they know and she told me yes, that the owner haven‚Äôt changed them but they are aware.",0
5,"Boba was chewy!
Little shop with less than 10 chairs where you can people watch the bustling corner of little Tokyo.
Parking is validated for I think 30 minutes for the attached lot.",0
1,"looks can be deceiving
taste bland
little pearl are sticking together like big balls mushy boba
taste like just milk with burned sugar

its my second time to order , 1st one is in lasvegas. yummy chewy. good. here i dont know what happend",0
5,"My friend is a stand seller at little Tokyo so we got bobas and the workers were so nice we even got free water refills for the day ice and the boba was so good, I would definitely recommend the boba and it is one of the best bobas I've ever had in my life. You should also try out the other things like their other bobas and more!!!! Love tiger sugar try it out guyssss yum!",0
5,Simple one in a million. Excellent customer service and delicious üòã tea üßã. Costume made your drink ü•§ of choice and nice ambiance. Great kids working together. ‚Ä¶,0
2,"The female staff member was very kind and likeable, the male staff member wasn't that great but I get it, working minimum wage is exhausting. The rating is really pertaining to the drinks than the staff or even the store itself.

We got the Strawberry Mochi Mousse and it tasted AWFUL! We shook it and it tasted like straight artificial overly sweet flavoring. I love sweets but we only took two sips of our drinks before just throwing the full cups away outside because it was so disgusting. It just tasted so fake and candy-like in the WORST way possible. I got mine with oat milk too, and it somehow added a nutty flavor to the drink but did nothing to make it taste better in any way that mattered.

We got the collab Hello Kitty cups which aren't even reusable, they're just paper cups! What's the point? Plus the tea would leak whenever I tipped the cup even slightly because the film they use to seal the cups was so flimsy. I stirred the straw gently and it tore the film.

Don't waste your money here, Boba Time is right down the street.",0
5,"Cute little place across from the revolving sushi restaurant. Picked up a Black Sugar Coffee Jelly and a Golden Oolong Tea Latte and they tasted amazing! Service was friendly and the prices are pretty fair compared to lots of other places, especially around Houston!",0
5,"Love it! All drinks are so testy!!!  Nice UI design, easy to order. Especially you can adjust your own sugar, ice levels.",0
3,"I think there is too much hype built up about brown sugar boba! It is very sweet and has a good molasses flavour. It was just too sweet for me personally and not as amazing as the Internet previously made it out to be. I tried coffee jelly for the first time, and it was also not my personal favourite. Sadly, I would have given 4 stars if there wasn't a preset expectation.",0
5,Delicious signature black sugar boba drinks with a friendly staff and comfy spot for people watching.,0
4,üëç ‚Ä¶,1
1,Drinks unfortunately were not good. The matcha was gritty and bland. The strawberry tasted artificial. Had higher hopes. The person who checked us out also seemed to be having a bad day.,0
5,Quaint little spot that deserves more love. Got a regular black sugar milk tea boba and it was excellent.,0
5,The worker Steven I believe his name was is such a good worker! My first time ever trying tiger sugar I did not know what to order and he helped me choose and asked me to try one of his favorite orders! It was super delicious and i‚Äôm glad he was so kind enough to do that for me :) 10/10 would go back! He remembers me as well and makes me the order when he is there!,0
3,I have had better boba elsewhere. We ordered a lychee tea with small boba.,1
2,"The guys are a bit rude and not giving much care. Watched another customer walk out and I should have taken it as a sign. 2/3 the drinks were fine, but my sister's drink tasted like straight milk. The guy gave her attitude to remake but she stood her ground and got it. Tasted more like the one I got at the end.",0
3,"The drinks tasted ok.  It took forever to use their credit card machine to pay for our drinks.  The cashier had to remove the cord, install it again, and take our orders again to make the credit card machine work.  The drinks were already ready when we are finally able to pay.  I hope they‚Äôll figure out a better way to pay by card.",0
3,"Been here a few times, pretty solid boba shop. But your employee Julian was a bit too aggressive I‚Äôm usually very lenient because I understand people can have a bad day but like the sarcasm and aggressive behavior ruined this place for me.",0
2,"jumbo ‚Äúboba‚Äù is NOT actually boba!! it‚Äôs balls of coffee jelly. didn‚Äôt taste bad, but was bland and very disappointing. badly advertised and incredibly misleading - for $8, definitely not worth it. however, workers were super nice and i hear their fruit teas are delicious.",0
1,"I had high expectations about this place because people usually say that it‚Äôs good but from what I experienced all I could say is that I will not be coming back to this place, the boba drink that I also got was too bland, no flavor or anything. Highly disappointed. Will stick to my 7leaves, tea is much better there",0
1,"The non-asian male cashier conversed, responded, and asked questions with a customer without looking at them. Wonder if that's how their parents taught them but I suggest they must have their manager reeducate them again.",0
3,"They have 3.5 üåü for a reason. Rude af and had to ask them to seal my drink (since I'll be walking around & didn't want to spill drink) was told they don't do it for kitty crush, yet when I asked they were sealing another 2 cups of kitty crush, make it make sense. Promo stated that if I bought a drink the sleeve would be 9.99 yet paid 12.99. At ktown, a friend bought 1 drink & 1 sleeve and got the promo but apparently regardless of 1 sleeve per person limit they just even bother to explain that I needed to buy another drink for the promo to work. Not sure if I'm gonna make the trip in the future to come here since it's a 30 min drive from home.",0
1,"Rude, poorly trained, unfriendly staff, and they got my order wrong. Although to be fair, even when they get your order right, the drinks here are sub-par at best. Do yourself a favor and walk across the street to Sunright or Gong Cha. Sunright even validates, which Tiger does not.",0
1,"The drink was okay at best. I mostly remember what a nasty attitude the cashier had. I visited on July 15, 2022 around 7pm and the cashier was a heavy set girl with curly hair. I simply and politely asked her if the drinks came with boba and she sighed looking very annoyed as she pointed to the drink where it says it contained pearls. I have never been to this shop before so I just wanted to clarify what is the problem with that? There was hardly anyone inside at the time what could be so difficult about answering a simple question? That was the first and last time I will ever go there. If you're looking for delicious bubble tea you will not find it here there are so many other options nearby.",0
4,"Soooo sweeet !
Brown sugar boba is amazing ! summer match !",1
1,"The worst boba drink I have ever had. Super watery, you absolutely don‚Äôt taste any tea at all. Overcooked boba - $7",0
1,"They're stingy with their syrups, because the drinks come out tasting so weird and missing sweetness. The first time i went , it was perfect but these last three times I've gone, I'm basically paying for $6 for a cup of milk with a dash of syrup. So disappointing every time.",0
1,"Ordered a Black Sugar Pudding Cream Milk Tea and the boba pearls were not sweet at all, was bland. The Milk Tea itself was not sweet as well. You could mostly taste only the milk. Was disappointed.",0
1,"Ordered green tea latte with half the sugar, tasted like sugar water, my daughter's black tea latte with recommended sweetness tasted like there was no sugar, and my little one never got her drink because they were out of strawberry jam. Still waiting for my refund.",0

5,"First tasted tiger sugar abroad, and it tastes the same here. Staff were very kind. Delicious boba, would recommend if you‚Äôre stopping by little tokyo.",0
1,"Tastes like sugar water and milk with boba. Doesn't taste like tea at all, and may not even have any tea. Technically, there's no mention of the word ""tea"" for #1 and #2 ""black sugar milk boba"", so who knows if it is even supposed to be tea. Very confusing, a bubble tea shop where the top 5 items are not even tea. Who drinks just sugar and milk without any tea? Go home, pour yourself some cold milk, dump a bunch of sugar in it, and that's what this is.",0
1,"I asked specifically for 100% sweetness and it tastes like plain water with tea, can't even taste the black sugar flavor

There's always Big line but that's only because there's barely any employees working, not worth the wait",0
5,I got their signature drink not too long ago and I can say it‚Äôs one of the best! As to the cashier they told me it was their most popular drink and I see why! I would be getting more drinks from there.,0
5,It is my favorite place to get boba! I make the trek from the westside just for this! Don‚Äôt miss out!,0

Not cool.",0

4,This is the Colima outlet of Tiger Sugar boba tea chain. I just tried the black sugar boba with cream large size. I tried this before but this cup had less flavor and not as good as before. This location is inside the strip mall for a drug store chain on the east end.,0
5,"The service was amazing, always making sure that the drink I got was perfect or he'd offer to re-do it which goes to show how much they care about their product. Staff was super friendly and the good amazing",0
5,"First time seeing no huge crowd waiting in line in front of the shop, so I had to stop and get some super famous brown sugar (Tiger Sugar) boba milk tea. They were good, as the ones in Taiwan. Don't compare the price, it costs so much more to hire people than in Taiwan. I don't live close enough to drink this everyday or whenever I want. As long as it tastes good when I get it, I am satisfied.",0
3,"I guess they had their grand opening a few weeks ago but it's still pretty crowded. It took about 15 mins for us to get through the order line and another 15 mins to get our order. It's honestly not bad but not great either...but for almost $6 for a boba drink, I would go somewhere else until the lines die down. Their bathroom looks like it's still under construction with no hooks for purses and tape on the mirrors. There was also a guy putting up their sign outside that took up some parking spaces. Maybe I've had brown sugar boba already so I'm not super wowed by it, but still try it for yourself to judge whether it's worth the wait or not.",0
5,"Unparalleled service. We walked in and were immediately greeted with a warm welcome. The owner suggested the brown sugar boba with tea after we were being indecisive.
He then made it quickly and it was so delicious. The boba is perfectly soft and chewy.",0
5,Wow! They opened a Tiger Sugar here in Rowland Heights! I believe the last time I had this was over a year ago in Taiwan. Glad to see some of these places that are popular in Taiwan come to the states. It seems like they have an easy online ‚Ä¶,0
5,"Went on a weekday night so there was no line.  The drinks are on the sweet side so ask for half sugar.  Had the #1 drink the most popular one, wish the tea taste a bit stronger but the milk was prefect.  $5 for the drink",0
5,"So many places that offer drinks with boba in the area, but this was the spot. It was small, no seating inside. It was crowded and you need to wait outside when you order. The store needs to add more seating outside. I will definitely go again. 5 minutes from the 60 fwy. Pricey.",0
5,This place has very limited options but to be honest that is wonderful because you get in and out real quickly. The drinks are definitely delicious. The time to make an order varies by day and time. But it is totally worth just trying out this place at least ones but I suggest asking what is the most favorite item. They have traditional Boba and sago the smaller version of it. They're both chewy and sweet.,0
5,I‚Äôve been heard my friends talk about this place for a long time. We waited for a little while and got into the store. My expectation was too high but it‚Äôs still decent boba for me. I like the milk and  I think the milk that they use is different from others. But if you ask me to spend 2 hours waiting in line that‚Äôs impossible.,0
4,"We ordered 3 large Brown Sugar Boba milk tea; $19 and some changes.  The boba textures were little too sticky outside and semi hard on the inside, so we concluded that their boba pearls were not fresh at that particular time (around 1pm). The brown sugar syrup flavor dominates the main taste which is nice.  We will try again next time and hope to gain better experience.",0

On a personal level I'm a fan of the tiger motif and am excited to stop by every though I actually find boba reprehensible. But this is one of the few places my teenage daughter still enjoys so for that alone, five stars.",0
5,"At first I didn‚Äôt expect much because how simple looking and fast it was, but when I had a taste, it was just! AMAZING. The taste lasted in my mouth and it tasted really good. The staff was also friendly with me! The line was long though, but it went really quick! The milk tea wasn‚Äôt very sweet or too plain, I highly recommend it!",0
5,Classic Black Sugar Boba Milk Tea. Love the dairy change option as soy/oat/almond without extra charge.,0
5,"Even in quarantine, the boba is outstanding and tastes unique for its performance. I got the brown sugar boba and it was an entirely different experience from other boba shops. I'm definitely coming here if I want a different taste next time!",0
4,Drinks were very social media worthy which I feel is the main reason people come here. Ordered #1 brown sugar milk tea with cream and it was pretty good. Flavor lasted wonderfully throughout the drink and pearls were made well too. Slightly overpriced for the size you receive which is why I give it a 4/5.,0

VALUE
Not gonna lie, it‚Äôs pretty darn pricey. $5.75 for my drink pictured. Personally I think it‚Äôs a bit overpriced.

TASTE
Disregarding price, the boba and drink from this place is top tier. Really chewy boba and loved the tea latte. I think the tea is essential. Without it, I‚Äôd just be drinking milk and sugar.

WOULD I COME BACK
I would definitely come back again if my friends wanted to go. I would not go on my own.",0

4,"I've been here a couple of times when they first opened up and just recently came back when I heard about their collaboration with Hello Kitty. The little girl in me could not resist and knew that I had to find a way to get my hands on their cupholders. Four hours into the opening day, the majority of the cupholders and plushies were already sold out. They still had the brown colored bow cupholder when it was my time to order. Since I've been here a couple times, their boba has always been generally pretty solid, perfectly chewy and bouncy. Maybe because it was the Hello Kitty collab and there was just so much demand, but the boba texture was definitely disappointing. It felt like it needed to be cooked more or simmered a bit longer before it was served. I did get to try their Hello Kitty drink which was essentially a strawberry milk with boba drink and it was pretty tasty but definitely for those with sweet tooths. I did like how they added dried strawberries on top.

Parking was a little challenging at the time because they only have a couple of spots in their lot. Although Walgreens is right next to it, they have a sign that says the parking spaces are specifically for Walgreens customers. I did find that there was another parking lot next to it that didn't seem to have those enforcements. You can also park on the huge lot on Batson Ave. and Colima Rd. and just walk over to Tiger Sugar, which is what we did.",0
4,"Great place, great drinks small parking, no sit down only to go. The are quick service, you come get your drink and leave. Perfect for what it is",0
3,Came here to get the Hello Kitty X Tiger Sugar drikk holders but they were sold out. This is a small to go boba shop with 2 outdoor tables for seating. Service was good and fast. The drink had too much ice so we felt ripped off but it tasted fine. Hello Kitty goods to be back in stock in a few weeks according to the workers.,0
1,"Boba was soggy, overcooked, and bland. Slow service. I only had one drink, but the cashier took 6 people's orders with multiple drinks after me, and made everyone's drinks at the same time instead of just making my 1 drink first. Other people had more than 1 drink.",0
5,"Finally, I got the chance to try Tiger Sugar! I've heard good things about it and am glad I tried it today. I see why this is one of the best brown sugar milk teas around! The milk tea was silky and smooth, and the brown sugar mixed in was perfect. The brown sugar is warm at the bottom when the drink is served, which is really nice, as it really goes well with the milk tea. In other places I've tried it, brown sugar is not as warm. I also liked how the drink was not super-sweet to the point of making you feel a little sick. Definitely recommended!",0

Got it for thr hype! It's pretty good. Only 4 stars cuz I'm more of a fruity boba kinda guy",1
1,"My boyfriend and I ordered the large strawberry green tea with boba and the brown sugar boba with cream. I was disappointed already because I went here just for the fact that they had cheese foam on the menu. When we got there, multiple toppings or menu items were unavailable. My drink had mushy boba and the green tea was very bitter tasting. My boyfriend‚Äôs drink was extremely sweet and the boba tasted burnt.",0
3,I went there to purchase a gift card for a friend who turned me on to this place . There were no advertisements to say they did or didn't and when I asked the CASHIER she didn't know . She did call a big dude out from the back and he knew how. Got a gift card emailed to me and I put it in my own Christmas card. üéÑ I was very surprised that they didn't have squat on the counter about any thing like that ! They could have made more sales !,0
3,"The green tea is sweetened nicely and the cup has a cool asthetic labeling, perfect place to take a snap and enjoy.",0
5,I had an amazing experience today. My first time visiting this location and I could tell you that I was welcomed and the barista was patient enough to recommend a good coffee boba tea that I was looking for. I set at the outside tables and the owner was kind enough to take time to genuinely get to know me plus offered a good tea! I could only rate 5 stars or else I would have rated 10/10!,0
5,My favorite boba spot! I like the flavors and the fact that they have the tiny pearl boba. Everyone is really nice here and the service is quick. I always get #1 but I need to try more stuff off their menu.,0
5,"Wow, hands-down, this is The Best Tasting Milk Boba I've ever had. Love it, hooked. Hope they will soon expand to Inland Empire.",0
5,There are so many options! And they were so nice to answer all my questions and explain what drinks and variations they had and were super fast! I like that we can adjust sweetness cuz I don‚Äôt like it too sweet.,0
4,Seen that place is busy all the time. I was tried black sugar Boba milk. Tested very good,0
4,Love this place. Always go with the brown sugar milk tea with white mousse. Beware: Make sure to mix very well!,0
3,The quality of the boba isn't to my expectations. It isn't worth the hype but you can give it a try.,0
5,Went here bcos of the hype back in Singapore and Indonesia (i didn't get the chance to try it). Their boba is definitely one of the best I've ever tried. It's more on the sweet side but it's just right. The caramelized sugar was legit! Boba is soft and chewy. My husband got one with the pearl and it was even better. They limit the number of customer in store for social distancing purpose. I only wish the cup was bigger and the location was nearer. It was a long drive from west LA. üòÇ,0
5,Best Boba that I have ever had!  Now I understand why there are always so many people here waiting for their order.,0
4,Came here for the Hello Kitty x Tiger Sugar collab but when I reached the registered we were limited to a single cup holder per customer when i've seen people walking away with 2 during release day. Atmosphere and staff were okay. Boba could be better. I walked away a bit disappointed and not as satisfied after paying $20.,0

3,The drink itself was good was disappointed with the boba though. We visited because of all the hype on Ig but in my opinion I've had better.,0
4,I absolutely love Tiger Sugar been coming here for about 2 years now. My top favorites here are Milo and A4 drink with coffee jelly. Their brown sugar boba has always been fresh and soft and chewy but lately the quality of their boba has been declining. I am happy they introduce a large cup size option for these drinks. üßã ‚Ä¶,0
1,I know it is the opening day.   Got here at 12NOON. They open at 1230.  It is currently 215PM. Not inside yet.  They are aware that there is a long line every time they open a new branch.  The least they can do is place shade on the long waiting area.  Those sunshades/tent are easily business expense. Have a staff member update the long line of people of what is happening and offer water for the people who has been in the line for more than 2 hours with a 90 degree weather. Not even a festive music even to celebrate the opening of this new place.   1 Star for how they treat their new customers.  The drinks better be good or else I won‚Äôt be back.  Check out the video I posted.,0

4,"We went on a Sunday afternoon, the line was not super long. We waited about 25 minutes but it could be because it was raining so the line was not ridiculously long. We ordered 2 #1 and they were really good. The boba was fresh and perfectly done. The drinks were on the sweet side but not too sweet. It was probably the best boba milk tea I have had in the greater LA area.",0
4,"Good boba place. We ordered the first 3 top drinks there. Like its name, the drinks have strong brown sugar flavor so if you like the brown sugar flavor, it's a great choice for you to try.",0
5,Friendly and accommodating staff. Great boba. Awesome place for a sweet treat on a hot day.,0
3,"Milk tea is decent, kinda tasted like cereal milk.. the tapioca pearls are small in size and they give you a large straw I didn't like that. I got Black Sugar Milk Boba it's also on the smaller size. The cashier who took my order was short seemed kinda bothered. If it's busy there is a line outside and one person inside the store at a time.",0
3,"They deliver average service with average boba tea. Nothing special. Limited boba menu. The quality is good, but like others have mentioned they use too much ice. I‚Äôd rather pay more money and get a cup of boba with less ice and more tea. The staff is immature and not professional at all, BUT it doesn‚Äôt affect the quality of the tea here. There‚Äôs tons of other shops in the area that are much better, however Tiger Sugar is one of those things that has a certain taste.",0
3,"I love Milk Tea Boba, and this place has good flavor. Is it the best? I say no, but definitely towards the better tasting ones.

I don't understand the hype since you can get similar tasting milk tea in other places as well.

One thing that irks me about this place is they fill the cup with 85% ice and the rest milk tea. Take 5 big gulps and it's gone.

I hate it when I finish the drink before getting to all the Boba. It happens all the time with this place. 3 stars is a very honest rating for the overall place. Milk tea taste, 4 stars.",0
5,Number 1 was good. The Boba was perfectly qq (chewy),1
2,"Great drinks and great boba, customer service isn‚Äôt the best. They‚Äôre quite snarky.

I cant have a drink with extra boba or light or no ice that I‚Äôll gladly PAY for. ‚ÄúNo adjustments‚Äù, really silly because the entire cup is ice and only two sips of the actual drink.",0
5,Love it. Ask for less boba if you don't like it too sweet.,1
2,"Generally speaking, the boba is good, but it would be awesome if the workers could be less arrogant during the morning shifts. I'm just here to buy a drink please. Sincerely wish you can start the day off happier and improve the quality of customer service!",0
5,I loved the Black Sugar Boba Milk with Cream Mousse. It was absolutely delicious & not that sweet. Some of the best boba I've had. I bought the large size & finished it before I even got home.,0
5,"Despite being its first day and grand opening, I thought the staff was still friendly and the quality was great.

Certainly tasted like the ones I had in the Philippines. Their brown sugar boba milk with cream mousse is uncanny, there is nothing like it no matter how hard other tea shops try to imitate their recipe.

For all the haters who complained about waiting in the hot sun for nearly 3 hrs... that‚Äôs obviously  on you for making that choice and not being prepared. That‚Äôs not the shops fault that everyone decided to go on opening day. They take their time on quality, so I‚Äôm okay with that and people should be more mindful of that.",0
5,So good the brown sugar drink is bomb they have all different types of boba. It's beautiful & tasty! The parking is easy right next to Wallgreens but in a good location. Staff is super friendly and the inside is clean and modern!,0
5,"This is the best Boba place around. Whenever we're anywhere near Vegas or LA, we make sure to hit up Tiger Sugar",0
5,"I always like stopping by here when I have to go to Rowland heights, their black sugar boba milk tea and their boba milk latte are always good!",0
5,"Love it!! Well balance on the sweetness, creamy and chewy boba. I order #1 and my wife order their black tea latte. Line move pretty fast, 12-15 ppl in front of me and took about 10 mins. Just waiting on the drinks took a bit longer than I expect. But overall good quality beverage!!",0
2,"Okay the drinks are pretty good but one staff docks the star down. The store is pretty loud so we hardly hear her call our order number so she screams out impolitely. When we come to pick up our order, she looks askance at us. I understand you‚Äôre busy but at least be polite",0
4,"OMG! Finally Tiger Sugar launches in LA. Even though I neither try the one in Taiwan nor New York, I heard Tiger Sugar in the recent year. So my review is most likely based on my taste buds. The boba is different from what I have tasted before. Its taste and texture are very unique. It is very chewy and with brown sugar caramel taste. The drink itself is not too sweet but the brown sugar caramel smell and taste are full of the drink. I can tell it is with quality. The last but not least, the milk in the drink is with quality as well according to the taste and texture. Based on the characters of the boba, the milk and the sugar, the drink is unique and high quality that should be impressive enough at the price of around 4-5 dollars. I would give this store 4 stars that I do believe there is always room to improve especially the wait time.",0
5,"drinks are one size, grab the boba milk tea and it's about $6 per cup. no modifications allowed.

granted the line wasn't too long, i thought it wasn't too bad. i came in and out in 5 minutes. i thought that this boba was one of the most unique tasting drink i ever had, it was really, really good. something about it had the same body as oat milk but i'm not sure what kind of cream they use. i'm so sad that this isn't any closer to my place as i'd love to stop by and get this daily. don't let the bad reviews discourage you.",0
5,I have not been impressed by Brown Sugar Boba or Tiger Sugar Boba at any other place but this place! The smoothest tasting version of this Boba flavor. They add a cream that gives it a distinct flavor and silky taste. I'd highly recommend and it definitely lives up the hype !,0
5,I'm usually more of a coffee guy than boba but I love what Tiger Sugar does to their drink. Everything is done meticulously and it shows through its presentation and taste. I've noticed them in Asia in my past few times back but there were always a long line. I was excited when I found out they were opening one hear just a short drive away. I avoided the crowded initially but have since gone a few times during off hours in the late afternoon. Now it is a treat for my kids and DW as well. I heard that they will start having coffee soon. I'll be looking forward.,0

A bit expensive about 5.20 plus tax for a cup about the size of a small drink McDonalds, but definetely a treat the Milk is excellent quality and Boba/Pearls were perfectly cooked. Minus one star for the price, but other than that absolutely delicious. Definetely worth a try if you havent had a chance.",0
4,"Not for tea!!

I ordered a brown sugar boba black milk tea. The boba tasted good but the tea was weak‚Ä¶  I think this place would be great for someone who is not looking to get milk tea.
But the service was nice and fast!!",0
2,"One if the worst Grand opening events I've ever attended. We arrived at 12:30pm. Line was already wrapped past the building.  At 2:00 they started taking down the umbrellas, chairs, and water. Taking away the already small amount of shade the line had. We got the number 5 and 3. Drinks were ok, kind of expensive for the size,$5.25 each for our drinks. Not worth the 3hr wait for a free tote bag. Oh and when we got to the register we were told they were out of boba. It was only 3:30 and they opened at 12:30...üòëüòëüòë",0
1,"üò™This is Bad. Listen up - there is a reason you cannot Customize your drink here. Why? Because You are paying for ICE! ICE! baby! More than half your cup will be filled with ICE! LOL. Cheap drink. Overrated nonsense.
Instead of this place, check out - 7 Leaves cafe boba teas/coffee! Amazing quality drinks there. Also check out ShareTea! (Oh and they customize their drinks the way you like it!) üòÄ",0
3,"I got 0% sugar and maybe that's why it didn't taste that great but other places warn you if that's the case..... it kinda just tasted like milk and even then the milk was not mixing well and you could see specks of milk clumps, sorry I don't know how to say it in English. It is definitely not worth the price",0
5,Probably one of the best I've ever had,0
1,"We arrived to the store at 1:15pm and proceeded to stand in line for 2.5 hours in the hot sun. We eventually got into the store and ordered our four drinks at 3:43pm. I asked to speak to a manager. I ended up talking to a guy named Chi. I told him it was completely unacceptable that on their grand opening that patrons were forced to stand in line for 2.5 hours without any water or shade. Chi stood there, nodded, and smiled like a psychopath while I told him how unacceptable this entire situation was. I asked what he was going to do about it and he replied, ""Let me think about it."" WHAT THE HECK ANSWER IS THAT? Later, he said he would send me a gift certificate via email-- I will be VERY surprised if he follows through on that. I also interacted with a second manager Kent who at least was very apologetic. He said he was really sorry about the situation and talked about how this was their first day, etc. I told him that people understand when things go wrong or are slow on a first day, but it's completely unacceptable to leave your patrons outside standing in a two hour line without any water or even acknowledgement. The least he could do is hand out water to them and explain what's going on or INTERACT with the patrons who are so excited to come to his store. He did end up buying a bunch of water and handing it out to people, but it was 2.5 hours too late. Hopefully nobody got hurt or too dehydrated from this experience.

Here's a list of things that I observed that the store could improve on.
1. It was 90 degrees and sunny. People were picking up cardboard boxes out of the trash to use it to shield themselves from the sun. UNACCEPTABLE! The staff should have been handing out water to the patrons who were standing in line or gotten some umbrellas. After my angry diatribe, I saw that waters were being handed out which was a good change, but it was still way too late
2. The line was extremely disorganized, the staff should have had some people outside working the line and interacting with the patients. The line went through the store, around the store, and then in the very back of the store. They should really have had someone standing there helping with line management, especially since there were cars going back and forth in the back. It would have been very bad if someone got hurt.
3. After about an hour of waiting, I saw some people rushing into the store with bags of ice-- looks like they ran out of ice on their first day. Unbelievable for a beverage store.
4. In 2.5 hours, they ran out of boba. Who runs out of boba at a bubble tea store AND on the grand opening day???
5. I counted 10 people behind the counter ""making drinks"". Why were there 10 people behind the counter to make beverages? And each of them were doing one task which was extremely weird. I think I saw one person 'weighing' the boba/pearls. That seems very inefficient. Get a spoon or cup that's the right size, you don't have time to weigh things.
6. One of the four drinks we ordered ended up having a few stray milk pearls, which was also weird.

Overall, this was a terrible experience and I would not recommend anyone to go. There are several bubble tea/boba restaurants within a one mile radius of this place. Honestly, if I hadn't been with a friend who was super excited to try this place, I would have left after half an hour.",0
2,"The line was long, the place was very small and you CANNOT customize any drink. It is very over hyped and it tastes like the one you order at 85 degrees, the difference is the one for 85 degrees is more affordable and it has more flavor.  Would not recommend it.",0
4,"The line was ridiculously long and took about half an hour for me to get my drink. It tasted good, but they need a more efficient way of getting people in and out of this plaza. Parking lot is too small for the large volume of customers",0
2,"Hilariously bad grand opening.

I enjoyed watching the world (and people) literally burn in the sun in our 2.8H waits from end of line to product in hand. Folks were using umbrellas, sweaters, blankets and even cardboard boxes to limit their exposure.

There were umbrellas outside-- but they were taken down at 2PM, just in time for peak heat at 3PM to really let everyone bake.

I was able to see management get blasted by angry customers and I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.

After getting blasted by the complaints, management started passing water out.

Tiger Sugar ran out of boba and asked me to substitute another item on their menu.

I do not believe the people waiting in line were made aware of the boba outage.",0
5,Loved this place wish we had one in Minnesota! Me and my friends came here to check it out and they gave us a free bag of their caramel popcorn when they found out how far we had traveled ‚ù§Ô∏è Great boba tea too!,0
3,Drinks are fairly good. They have primarily caramelized sugar drinks with a cream mousse. Staff is not great and could use improvement in CSR. Plenty of other shops with knowledgeable and friendly staff.,0
5,Sarah provides excellent service!! She makes a mean Thai Tea Latte too‚Ä¶,0
4,Been to this place a couple times. Would go more of they didn't have a line all the time. Their signature tiger milk tea is awesome. Boba is hit or miss though.,0
5,So delicious!! Employees are super friendly and the black sugar with pudding boba is so yummy! My favorite new boba spot,0
5,Brown sugar milk and boba was best I had and went around 9:30 pm . Fresh and tasty were I craved the brown sugar milk. Staff is a 10,0
4,The place is great if you're into drinks that aren't sugar bombs. The one downside is the price for the quantity given. It's definitely still worth a trip.,0
1,"I've been here four+ times to order drinks and use the restroom and every time, while there are FOUR to SIX employees working here at the time, they always say(and have a sign that says), the restroom is OUT OF ORDER. This is extremely inhumane working conditions for over two years now. Get the restroom/s fixed for THEIR sakes.",0
3,What's the rave about? It's another basic boba place that tastes just like all the others. The drink is mediocre and tastes just like bland sugared milk.,0
5,"Delicious boba and sugar is free in all drinks. If diabetic this might be a place of heaven but beware, too much tiger sugar can be bad for you.",0
3,Went there and somewhat crowded but not bad.  Different  and could have been better.  Not really clean using same towel to wipe cup of tea down and then counter.  Cv19 era so need different practices.,0
4,Tiger sugar is not like any other boba place they have their own unique style and flavor of milk tea and coffee lattes.,0
5,"Friendly staff, the dude know his stuff.
I got the #1 with oat milk.",1
5,Best bobba ive ever drink! Sadly its too far. U guys need more locations in LA!,1

4,First time being there. Love the drink. Especially the Black Sugar Boba Milk Cream Mousse. It was good.,0

4,Yummy-)) Classic Brown sugar milk tea boba,1

2,Ordered #3 and #12. Overhyped. Drinks are nothing special. Boba has good consistency.,1
5,Very tasty desert drinks. I ordered b2 the creme Brule. Lots of flavor very good. Drink it cold,0
2,"Too much ice in the drink, infect more than half of the cup was ice. Very small cup for $5.25. So not worth it. Do NOT recommend",0
4,I order their popular drink which is number 1 and the milk drink is rich and creamy but the boba is on the bland side(compare to half & half).,0
4,Slightly overpriced but it's a solid place for drinks and the mini boba was very soft to bite through,0
5,Amazing. They specialize in brown sugar milk teas and they do it so well. I get the number 7 but the 6 is just as good.,0
3,"This place is pretty overall rated, its just milk and their Boba taste is above average.",1
5,They have Oatly Oat Milk! No extra cost. We did not have to wait in any line and the service was very friendly and quick!,0
5,Milk drinks are delicious. I really like their black tea. Tastes like a sweet tea that you can taste the tea in.,0
1,"When you ask for NO ICE they refuse, and day it's part of the receipe.  How can Ice be part of a receipe? Ice is used to keep things cold, so they're trying to burn people for 6 bucks..",0
5,Love coming here when I get a chance. There was no line when I went on a Saturday afternoon. I always ask for 70% sugar and less ice.,0
5,"So delicious!!!

5,Omg Love Love this place best drinks ever all I have to say is this will be my first choice and Starbucks second....,0
5,"Recommend the black sugar boba and pudding! The pudding tastes like Vietnamese flan, very good!",0
1,"This company steals art and uses it towards its own marketing without crediting the artists, all while continually whining on its own social media pages about knockoffs of their own brand. Shady.",0
3,"Over priced for alot of ice, Boba and small amount of fluid. Overall the drink was decent.",1
1,"Something changed from when the place first opened.  Dunno what happened.
Maybe in with the new shops and outdated with the old shops?",0
5,"Love their boba milk tea,ice cream and popcorn, try it all and you'l fall in love with all of it.",0
5,The brown sugar made the boba tea taste super unique. Will come back in the future.,0
5,This was probably one of the best milk teas ive ever had it was so scrumdidlyumptious 5/5 would reccomend,0
1,"If you have questions, be ready to drive to location and ask them because they can't answer their phones.",1
1,"Small cups, I ask light ice, but when I finished drink, more than half cups ice still there! They charged $5.65 after taxes, how come we spend money for lot of ice?!",0
5,"If you love boba drinks, then this is the place you have to go and try...",0
4,Drink was really good. The only thing is the parking and no seating in or around the store...shame...,0
1,Had hot boba milk. It came with only half a cup and super sweet,0
4,Line wasn't as long as I thought. Place is definitely over hyped. But I'd definitely go again.,0
5,Love everything I‚Äôve tried. Efficient staff and can order ahead to avoid long lines during peak days / hours.,0
5,"Personally, this is the best tasting tea I've ever had.",0
4,"Boba flavor is great, the boba itself though could be chewier.",0
1,"Expensive for tiny cup, not sweet at all, totally disappointed, the only good thing they served us fast‚Ä¶",0

4,Didn't have large cups two times that I went,1
3,too sweet,1
5,Best boba in LA. Period. Taiwanese business FTW!!!!,1
4,It has the perfect amount of sweetness. But the portion is small for the price,0
1,Refused to do the no ice option. Refused to do the less sugar option. Cup is very small.,0
5,The boba is fantastic. Make sure to try the boba pops,0
5,"Great milk tea drinks, sweet, and smells fantastic.",0
4,Ok boba came here with my family during our summer vacation to California,0

4,"It was small but cozy. Perhaps because we went during the day, there weren't many customers.",0
1,"I went there today before it opened at 12 o'clock. After queuing for half an hour, I was finally able to order. The reasons for negative reviews are as follows:
1. All the drinks listed on the menu can be made into hot drinks, but the ordering guy said that 1-7 are not available.
2. I ordered No. 10 green tea. The instructions and the note may indicate no ice, but what I got was still ice.
3. When I got home half an hour later, my wife couldn't drink cold drinks, so she took out the ice, but it was half the amount. That means half of the money you paid was ice for you.",0
3,"Bad attitude. No cash, No plastic bags, you can't ask for no ice, and you can't ask for more pearl.
No cash, no plastic bags, no ice, no pearls. The attitude is rather bad. The portion is still small, but there is still a lot of ice.
Why don't I go to Yifang?",0
1,The cashier lady used the excuse that she didn't know Chinese to make a bad face at people who spoke Chinese. It was disgusting! Most of your guests are Chinese. Is this appropriate?,0
5,"The pinnacle of brown sugar hanging on the wall, the pearls are more delicious than the boba, and the pudding tastes good too",0
5,"I don't like sweet and greasy things, but it's so delicious that I go to this place whenever I feel like it. It's far away and there's always a line, so I can't help but go.",0
1,"The service attitude is very poor, especially the person responsible for placing orders",0
5,"First experience, the boba tastes good when you open the door.",0
4,"Sorry for the 4 stars, it's because they sell the same thing with different company",0
3,The brown sugar taste is obvious and tastes good,1
1,Very bad service attitude,1
5,"It was my first time trying their Bubble tea, and it is really good! The waiting time is short. I also appreciate the convenience of being able to order either online or at a kiosk.
I recommend the Black Sugar Boba.üßã ‚Ä¶",0

1,"Rude lady. Got a #10. The straw provided was way too small and kept falling in. When asked for a straw that would actually fit, she rudely replied that they just have one size.
How am I even supposed to drink this. Never coming here again.",0

5,My new favorite boba place! Try their popular brown sugar milk tea with less sugar and less ice. I prefer it with no cream. Their strawberry mochi is also pretty good!,0
5,"Tiger sugar is the best bubble tea spot in NYC. THAT BROWN SUGAR IS TO DIE FOR! customers service is relatively fast, depending on whose there. But sometimes I see mad orders and 2 workers. They pump out them teas like a factory while maintaining quality control.",0
5,This is one my favorite bubble tea spots in manhattan. It's in such a central location and easy to get to. I think they have one of the tastiest bobas ever. I highly recommend their brown sugar milk and the taro milk drink.,0
5,"My favorite tiger sugar in the city.

Is it pricey? Yes
Is it yummy? Totally
Is it worth it? Hello yes hell yea

They offer milk alternatives like soy, coconut, oat for lactose haters like me. I recommend coconut milk! The mango pomelo is also delicious and my go to if I‚Äôm looking for something refreshing",0
5,"One of the best places for bubble tea.
Theres only 2 self checkout kiosks and people take so long to put in their order. ‚Ä¶",0
5,"Authentic Taiwanese boba with great prices and so many flavors to choose from the menu. I particularly like the fact that they have a touch screen in front of the store for self-order. It's a game changer. It makes everything easier, faster and less awkward especially for busy people like I am. I can simply order by myself and adjust the drinks the way I like it without having to answer questions from a cashier person. Smart operation! Highly recommended!",0
4,Got mango sago. It was great but the mango wasn‚Äôt ripe. It was noticeably hard and sour. My wife got lychee tea (F4) and we loved it!! Has a strong flavor but isn‚Äôt too sweet which I find is rare as far as lychee stuff goes. Staff was rude honestly. Definitely don‚Äôt go if you have hearing issues as the person behind the register was impatient with me for not being able to hear her as I lip read a lot and she had a mask on.,0
5,"Really yummy bubble tea! There‚Äôs always a line but wanted to try. You can order at kiosk outside or scan to order online.
Love that there is a non-dairy option (soy milk). The black sugar boba is delish. Yes, it‚Äôs a little sweet and you can‚Äôt adjust the sweetness on the milk teas but it was good. Really good price too.
I went back and tried their matcha and mango boba drinks. As a huge matcha addict, it wasn‚Äôt as good as I expected but the mango was tasty. I think they excel with their tiger sugar milk teas.",0
1,The staff treat blacknpeople like trash. I asked staff add more sugar before they made the drink.they didn't listen. When I asked 2nd time they gavevme attitude speech they can't add more sugar after spending $8.hire more inclusive staff there all asian.this os america share dollar,0
5,"Tiger sugar is Top 3 of my favourite bubble tea store in NYC.  Black Sugar Boba with Pearl Milk is the best for me.

Caution: Finding the right sweetness balance is crucial. Be mindful to ensure your preference aligns with the sweetness offered for the best enjoyment.",0
4,"Came by in the afternoon to try the Hello Kitty crush but disappointed to find out that it already sold out for the day. All the drinks do come in the Hello Kitty cups though so that's a good consolation.

There are two tablets to order from, one inside and one outside the store. There were only two people working when I visited so the staff made the drinks in batches. It was the first time I ever waited 20 minutes for a bubble tea drink.",0
2,Ordered a BS milk with boba & cream mousse yesterday 4pm and there was no cream mousse in it. I was mostly craving the cream mousse :( Like that‚Äôs only 2 toppings when the store‚Äôs empty with 1 drink waiting on the counter how do you even miss that?? Gimme my money backüôÑ ‚Ä¶,0
4,"It's a pretty small place, has a kiosk outside to order at. The wait time is a bit long but the drinks were all very good!!",0
4,"I‚Äôve heard about this place and have been wanting to try it in forever. Finally got to check it out today with my coworker, second bubble tea shop this year around the area after trying fiftylan last week. Pricing is cheaper here compared to fiftylan and drinks are comparable.

Decent bubble tea shop, could use friendlier staff though, kiosks shows you more options than ordering with a person, they also only take cash if you order with the staff. I‚Äôd pick the kiosks going forward with my experience. You can also get points and redeem it in the future for a free drink.

I picked their signature drink, brown sugar boba with less ice and less sugar and whole milk and cream on the top. Good to try if you haven‚Äôt had it. The tapioca came in different sizes which threw me off a bit, haven‚Äôt had mixed size bubble/pearls so that was interesting. Flavor is pretty authentic coming from someone who drinks bubble tea growing up in taiwan :) so good to give it a shot!

I went right around when they opened so there was no line, around 12:35ish.",0
5,Escaped the rain and we were going to try another Boba place close to BCD but drinks were $10+. Ran into this shop and tried the fresh taro with small boba..holy molay that was good,0
5,"So glad that I no longer need to travel to Chinatown or Flushing for Tiger Sugar!

I stopped by on a Thursday night, and the service was fast! This location is slightly smaller than the one in Chinatown.

I had to get my favorite - no. 5 black sugar boba + pudding milk with cream mousse. Yum!

I liked the idea of having a paper straw -  but guess what, it doesn't work on the film that was covering the drink!

The drink was delicious, creamy, and the black sugar boba was divine - this is coming from someone that doesn't like bobas.

The only thing I'd suggest for this business is to serve it with less ice. I was having a hard time fishing out my pudding and boba as they were sitting underneath all the ice cubes.",0
5,"Probably only place with boba coffee with pearls, both hot and cold. Loved it, Def going back to try different things next time. Healthy and customizable",0
2,"I‚Äôm a weekly boba drinker, and this is one of the worst bubble teas I‚Äôve had in NYC. I got the brown sugar milk tea with tapioca, and it was almost all ice and water with little flavor. I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre using covered cups to deter you from seeing how it‚Äôs all ice. I can‚Äôt believe I wasted $7.50 on this when there are so many options in K-Town. I do not recommend.",0
5,Went two days in a row! Had black tea with black sugar boba with 50% sugar. The tea has a strong tea flavor which we love. Some places you can tell the tea was light and watered down. The boba has soft texture and good black sugar flavor. ‚Ä¶,0
5,"The boba is really good. Lines aren‚Äôt very long or slow, so it‚Äôs great. The service was good and there are many fruit options which I really liked. Definitely a place to check out.",0
5,"I'm so happy that another location opened! You can't go wrong with their signature drink.
It's definitely a closer location for me and their drinks are always delicious! ‚Ä¶",0
1,"I ordered 3 Milk Boba Pearl Tiger Jelly drinks; I asked for less ice and instead got the whole cup full of ice- I could barely taste the drink. üò± For my 3 extra large drinks order I was offered no bag to carry it all and no straws. When I asked for a bag and straws,  the lady at the counter without saying a word threw my drinks into a bag and pushed it towards me‚Ä¶

Honestly, I don‚Äôt get this attitude.
I suppose, it‚Äôs a way of showing me that I didn‚Äôt add a tip when ordering my drinks at their touch screen menu‚Ä¶?  The place doesn‚Äôt even have a seating area; you order your $8 drink and go; why tips are being extorted?",0
5,"Been coming to Tiger Sugar for years now, mainly the Ctown location. So it‚Äôs great to see them in Koreatown. The drinks are great and the staff are always helpful. You can order in person, via kiosk, or from Snackpass (online). I recommend getting their signature, #1 but definitely should try others if you can!",0
5,Most amazing boba I've ever had ü•∞ü•∞ so delicious and chewy! Perfect level of sweet. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a treat!,0
2,"not the typical type of boba drinks. If you are looking for dessert-like drinks then this may be the place for you. We ordered boba pudding milk tea. The milk tea and boba are pale, even soulless. The ingredient ratio is off. Tastes like a combination of different types of artificial sweets. Not worth the wait and definitely won‚Äôt come back.",0
5,Finally tried their boba and loved it. My bf had the Mochi one w tapioca and I had the large tapioca brown sugar. The wait line is long but it‚Äôs really convenient to order through their self service machine.,0
5,Whenever I go to K-town I come here for boba. Just wanted to give my thanks to the worker here this evening on Nov. 26 who held onto the bag I had forgotten. I could have lost my shoes for good ü•π‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Ä¶,0
4,Drinks were great! Had lactose free options which was great because my stomach doesn‚Äôt digest whole milk well. Had topping free options which was great too. One thing I would say is that it had too much ice which forces you to drink slowly. Overall great place for bubble tea especially for the price.,0
5,Tried the bs mik boba tea. I'll say i loved it,1
4,"They have a good quality of bubble tea they have a signature drink which is the most selling bubble tea and I would also recommend the same for the first timers here as you can order that blindly‚Ä¶ the space is small and one this was off that we can only at by cars through the kiosk ,they only accept cash over the counter‚Ä¶",0
4,"Good boba milk tea store. A good variety of selections.

The strawberry mochi is good. Not too sweet and I totally love the mochi. It‚Äôs very chewy.

Brown sugar matcha latte is okay. Nothing special. Some of the matcha powder is not even dissolved.",0
3,No wonder the store went from waiting 10 mins in line to hardly any customers. We love you guys but our drink tasted like milk with a hint of sweetness.,0
5,This place ranks high on my list of favorite bubble tea spots in Manhattan. Its central location makes it easily accessible. They serve some of the finest boba I've ever tasted. I highly recommend their brown sugar milk and taro milk drinks.,0
1,Not good. It wasn‚Äôt refreshing or tasty at all tbh i wish i didn‚Äôt spend so much on this. Mango pomelo tastes like it was canned and is way too sweet & artificial tasting i cannot finish the drink.,0
5,"There Mango-sago is so good!! I eventually drank it so much, that I retired from getting it.  BEST DRINK!!!",0
5,Love that the quality stays consistent no matter where you go. I always recommend their #1 to friends. Definitely one of the best brown sugar boba I've had outside of Taiwan. I also appreciate the lactose free milk option rather than just almond/oat/coconut milk. Prices are reasonable for NYC. Service was fast and friendly. Would come back again.,0
1,"I love bubble tea and have tried many places in NYC, but my last visit here was the worst. I ordered a mango sago and waited over 20 minutes. When I checked with the male staff after receiving a ""ready"" text, his attitude was unpleasant and rude, and he said the message was wrong and you should only come here when calling you. Even after customers who ordered after me got their drinks, mine was still not ready, and he didn‚Äôt give me a clear time. Eventually, the female staff delivered my drink. On a hot day, my friends and I waited 20 minutes in the sun, dealing with this rude service. I won't be back and suggest others avoid this place due to the poor service and long wait times. Not worth it!",0
5,"Excellent brown sugar milk tea üßã
The taste of the milk is so good. Very creamy andthe sweetness is just right. They don‚Äôt let you choose the sweetness level but the taste is the best.
The pearls are so soft and chewy!!!!! So so good!!!",0
4,You order and pay on the automated machine and then wait while they complete your order. The wait was a bit long and the space is very small and no place to sit. But the drinks were great.,0
1,"Sometime when boba sold out, they will put only brown sugar sauce but no boba in your tea. Check it before leaving. Enjoy :(",0
5,"As a Taiwanese, the taste is exact the same as I drink in Taiwan. However the price is about 3 times expensive than in Taiwan.
Yet, in the states, if I can get something taiwan flavor, it is worth you to spend some money on it.",0
5,"I‚Äôve been a fan of their Brown Sugar Boba ever since, so I‚Äôm glad that they have the XL option now. I got the one with the pudding and it‚Äôs amazing!",0
5,"Back here again!! I love it!! Brown sugar boba!! It‚Äôs so fresh and refreshing!!
Will keep coming back!! It‚Äôs one of my favorite in the city!!!",0
4,They have branched out their offerings. It used to be solely on brown sugar bubble teas varieties but now they have other offerings just like a common bubble tea joins. A little disappointed of their new concept. Personally I think they should just exclusively do variety of brown sugar  offerings.,0
5,This is the best tasting boba I‚Äôve had and it‚Äôs also like the cheapest I‚Äôve gotten too. If you‚Äôre in Ktown you gotta hit up tiger sugar!,0
1,A long hair stuck inside between the drink sealing. I am concerned about safety and sanitation of all these drinks from this store.,0
5,I ordered a peach oolong tea and a passion fruit oolong tea with bubbles. They were both so delicious. Cannot wait to come back!,0
5,Got the mango sago and really liked it. Good flavor and toppings with the coconut jelly as well. Tall size too.,0
2,"Ughhh. I love their bubble tea, especially their boba. But it‚Äôs really disappointing this time. I ordered with pudding and paid extra. But there‚Äôs no pudding inside.",0
5,"The taro milk was THE BEST taro milk that I ever had! It had fresh taro, taro pudding, creame mousse, boba, and I picked oat milk. 10/10 it was perfect and I definitely will be coming back!",0
5,"Used the ordering machine in front of the store, which was a bit slow. But dont be fooled! They have another ordering machine in the store!

But the drink was nice, as usual!",0
4,"Loved the taste of the drinks!
The only reason I‚Äôm not giving it 5 stars is because of the service. They seemed annoyed with the rush and filled the cup with 2/3rd ice even after we specified ‚Äòless ice‚Äô",0
1,"The drinks were very disgusting, it's like no sugar was added to them. I don't suggest going to this business to buy any drinks. ü§Æüëéüèæ
I literally had to add coconut milk to my drink.",0
1,"One of the worst drinks I've ever had in my entire life. Despite the boba tasting decent, something was mixed throughout my entire drink that I've never had in any other similar drink. Throughout was a mucus like substance that had no flavor and was difficult to both get through the straw and consume. There was also a powder present throughout the drink as well, probably due to poor mixing. The employee spoke not a word to anyone and just made these horrible drinks in silence. We tried this place based on the glowing reviews but it definitely was not up to the level of expectations some seem to have. Either better training needs to be performed or different recipes need be crafted. The location and the general vibe of the music and design were the only saving graces.",0
5,Everything I‚Äôve had here has been amazing! Last time I got the most popular one with the 2 different sizes of boba and it was fantastic.,0
5,"Very good bubble tea, one of the bests!",0
1,"For some reason the counter is CASH ONLY which is fine but to pay card is $7 for a green tea instead of $6. We all trying to survive out here but this level is a little outrageous. Also the clerk had no intention of being there, and was colder than my ice green tea on a rainy october night.",0
5,"I wish I took a picture before I drank it, but I got the strawberry mochi since i‚Äôm not a milk tea person and I tell you Tiger Sugar did not disappoint me. Went home dancing and I want more üòå Great Job!",0
3,"good bubble tea it has small little pearls and big pearls, but it didnt have the wow factor i expected. its regualt bubble tea with condensed milk flavor.",0
5,"NGL, best boba tea I have ever had. This might just be the only thing I will miss about NYC!",0
5,"Best bubble tea place I've tried in Manhattan, their tapioca is so soft and chewy, and ice and sugar levels are customizable to fit your liking! They also have cold as well as hot options, which is great for when it's cold outside.",0
5,"Very good place. I like how they put both boba and pearl. They don‚Äôt let you change the size, ice, or sugar level. I understand that they do it to keep the same consistency, but I wish if they allow for more options.",0
4,Tiger sugar always is my favorite boba tea .,1
4,"Love love love the brown sugar drink. So sweet and great. Somewhat of a long wait though, and they were out of large bubbles and substituted small pearls.",0
5,"Most of the time I get the brown sugar iced latte with bubbles (pictured) only because I usually need a pick-me up. You can‚Äôt go wrong with their bubble tea though, the best in the city.",0
5,"There is a QR code on a A frame board, that‚Äôs how you place an order. Easy system to use. Drinks came quickly and tasted delicious.",0
5,"I really liked ordering on a kiosk and not taking up any staff time, and I liked that it sent you a text when your order was ready, I just wish the staff didn‚Äôt send it preemptively. The brown sugar milk was fantastic, and my fianc√© got the taro which had good taste, but was a tad grainy. I may go back when I visit NYC again.",0
5,So pricey but this is the only place that offers lactaid milk as an option. Thank you for saving my stomach and toilet üôè ‚Ä¶,0
1,"I'm currently still in store 25mins after ordering two fruit teas and have no drink in hand. The girl behind counter is stacking the new orders on top of the older orders. Orders placed after mine have been made & picked up. I've had better drinks from other places and add the wait time, I will never return here.",0
5,"Very impressed with this bubble tea shop in Korea Town. It‚Äôs clean and run very efficiently. There‚Äôs a kiosk outside for self order/check out. You can also order via QR code on your phone, but note that it requires you to confirm your card information several times.

Once your order is placed, you are given a number that appears on a large display over the counter. The drink is made quickly and was delicious although the less sugar option was not sweet enough, so I‚Äôll try the regular option next time! üßã",0
4,"If you want bubble tea on steroids, then this place is it. Extremely unhealthy and super sugary but if you want an indulgent treat, suggest you head here. You can order from the kiosk to save time. Drinks are all super dense and filling.",0
3,The worker was very rude to me when I asked for an extra cup and when I was ordering my items she spoke extremely low and I could barely hear anything she was saying to me.She gave me attitude and rolled her eyes at me because I wanted a cup. I understand it‚Äôs not easy working for long hours but it‚Äôs important to treat nice customers with decency. I felt very uncomfortable I even forgot to get a straw for my boba.,0
4,I ordered Matcha Latte Bubble Tea for me and my friends as a treat. I can tell good bubbles from not so good ones based on the fragrance from cooking bubble pearls with brown sugar.  Our drinks tasted yummy and the bubbles are flavorful and chewy. Wish there are some outdoor seating available. Will come visit again.,0
5,"this is my favorite place to get a dirty milk tea. they mix in tiny and normal sized tapioca pearls which is the best thing ever because they‚Äôre soft and satisfactory every visit ! it‚Äôs very easy to order boba at the one booth located near the front door, the wait time is usually never too bad even when busy. a bit pricey, but worth the splurge every once in a while.",0
5,One of the best bubble tea in city. You can make your selection of how you would like your bubble tea. Can order in the shop using the shop tablets stand near by the door and pay using contactless payment.,0
4,Brown sugar drink was good given the hype! Glad I was able to try it at least once. The staff were really nice.,0
4,"- great milk tea coffee - not too sweet nor sugary at ""less sugar""
- needed to add more ice; the ice melted so quickly that the drink became warm
- super cute cup with collab with Hello Kitty

Inside the store:
- 0 seating
- small bar area where you can stand and drink for 2-3 people

Easy grab and go place.",0
5,"Best boba in the city!
The taro is one of the best flavors.
It‚Äôs pretty quick when you order from the app Snackpass, otherwise you can order from the screen and it easy also.",0
5,One of my favorite place to go.,1
4,"Staff was helpful when I was struggling with their tablet to order a drink. The drink was good, but the boba was cold and chewy toward the evening. Wish they had kept it heated regardless of the time, but I will try to come back earlier in the day next time.",0
1,"I want to share the horrible experience @K-town location with the worker who claims to be the manager at the location. I ordered Boba w/ Cream Mousse with Lactose Free and Cheese Mousse. I was waiting for my drinks when the employee called out my number. He just initially said, ""we cannot make this drink"". I was confused, so I asked, ""why not?"" and he said he cannot add cheese mousse on a drink that has lactose free option. I told him that it's okay b/c I'm actually not lactose-intolerant, but I prefer to drink it for the taste. He then took it back to his co-worker and looked like they were discussing something. He called me again then said, ""we cannot do it"". And I asked for explanation and he said, ""If something happens, we cannot be responsible."" So I told him that I always order it lactose-free with cheese mousse and then he said something outrageous, ""it's company policy and we cannot do it"". I then mentioned that if that's company policy, there shouldn't be an option to add it on the ordering kiosk system and if that's the case, it should've been written somewhere. He didn't reply to my response and just repeatedly said, ""we cannot do it."" No apologies, no thorough explanation, but rude response with lack of customer service. I asked for a manager, but he said he was the manager. If that's the case, Tiger Sugar should really work on educating managers on how to handle customer service. I'm a fan of Tiger Sugar, but I never want to visit K-town location for the rude employee there.",0
5,This is the best boba shop I‚Äôve ever been to!!,0
5,Never disappoints. My favorite boba place in all of NYC.,1
1,"I really like tiger sugar but this store has the worst service! Will not return again! The worker was rude to customers and when I ask for a bag, she is like ‚Äúze‚Äù and when I tell her my number and said that one is my drink, she did not give it to me even though I repeated my number twice! I understand they are tired but please have a better attitude when you facing your customers! The taste is weird!",0
5,"Absolutely wonderful food on the 39th floor of the Nomad Tower. The food is equal to the view. We will be back. Attentive service, good meat, and a unique view.",0
5,"Very strong tea flavor. Love it. But if you prefer something sweeter, better add some sugar.",0
5,Really good bubble tea! Favorite spot in Korea town!,1
2,"I like the tiger sugar, but not the 32nd location. Yesterday I asked to put me less ice, to which the girl at the counter answers me no.  I asked why?  She replies that she can't give me less ice.  I don't understand why it's so hard to take and put less ice?  And the guy next to her answers me that they cannot, as it seems to be the rules of the company.  I was surprised.  In all places where bubble tea is sold, people can adjust the amount of ice at will.
Well, in the end I waited for my drink, I ordered a matcha.  And unfortunately, the drink was made bitter.  The last time I was here, it was delicious and sweet, but this time the matcha turned out to be bitter.",0
5,"Happy to find this in ktown! Loved my drink and even though there's a line, you get it pretty quick!",0
5,"The chocolate malt flavor is way better than you think, I promise you. Try it.",0
3,"I really like this boba place, but the wait was so atrocious. They got the order wrong as well. I ordered 50% ice, and had no ice in my drink I waited 20 minutes for. Everyone has off days, but this was a disappointment.",0
5,"seriously my favorite boba place, but I recommend having two workers on the weekend, took a long time to get my drink, not the employees fault he was moving very fast, but it‚Äôs an inconvenience for him and the customers. please have at least two people!",0
4,"Small shop, with a kiosk to put in your orders. The drinks are good as expected from Tiger Sugar. The wait and the prices can be a bit high for some people. I go when I notice there is no line. Otherwise, I don't bother.",0
5,"Fast order and pick up process, delicious strawberry mochi bubble tea, overall great bubble tea spot in Koreatown.",0
5,"Newest tiger sugar location in Koreatown! They launched three new drinks as well: Mango Pomelo Sago, Taro Pudding Black Sugar Boba Milk, and Matcha Black Sugar Boba Milk. I really really love the bubbles/ boba here. They‚Äôre warm and perfectly chewy. It‚Äôs a grab and go location. Would recommend.",0
5,Taro pudding is THE BEST. I love the fresh taro and the pudding mixed in. Next level treat. Line can be long so be prepared with some patience. It's worth the wait.,0
5,This stuff is crack! First time trying it and I‚Äôm obsessed. Great place to go on a date,0
4,"Boba was really good! But it is a tiny shop and can get very busy, and the kiosk ordering system doesn‚Äôt really let you customize your drink.",0
5,Always had a good moment after drink Tiger Sugar,1
4,It's tiger sugar. The hello kitty cup got me. Other than that it's just tiger sugar.,1
5,"Why the reviews are so low, it‚Äôs great bubble tea ever",1
1,"Well to the girl that‚Äôs working 7/29 around 2 pm

I don‚Äôt know why my drink was there already and I told her my number twice she just wouldn‚Äôt give me my drink because they didn‚Äôt press the number on the screen for my number.

It‚Äôs not like there are lots ppl waiting or very busy.

She just looked at me and told me to wait ?
Like i literally saw my drink there and why did you have to give me such an attitude ?

Well I even put in a tip, I would rather throw them away than have to deal with this attitude for no reason .",0
5,Good Location and Classic Taste.,1
1,"So rude! I asked the staff to put a little less boba in my boba tea before she even starting making it since I couldn‚Äôt choose no boba. Her answer: NO. lol.
Its not like the were busy. I was the first customer and no one else was there.
Terrible place.",0
1,"July 10  2.25 pm

4,"obsessed, just wish the wait time wasnt always like 10 minutes üò©",0
5,"This place is much better than Biao Sugar. I normally don‚Äôt like bobas, but this place‚Äôs bobas are soft and flavorful. I ate all the bobas in my drink and liked them.",0
3,"The service is not the greatest, head to 50 Lan one block down instead. Or try another branch. The boba is comparable and there‚Äôs more space to sit there.",0
4,This was one of the best boba drinks we tried here! The drinks tasted so rich and flavorful! Must try!!!,0
4,"Pretty quick service, they were closing.  The bubbles were in 2 different sizes, super tiny AND regular.  That was interesting.  Clear signage in Chinese and English. $6 for a regular size...",0
5,Grand opening in KTOWN. I tried something different this time. The Oolong tea latte is as good as their signature brown sugar milk tea. . I love it !,0
5,"Great drink !! My fav spot but i am not sure about the staff who is taking the order ,its seem like i ask for free drink ! ;(",0
1,They use Silk for oat milk. Don‚Äôt order with oat milk. Please switch to Oatly or Minor Figures,1
1,The drink was delicious but was 90% Ice. Other NYC locations are much more generous with servings given.,0

5,"This Tiger Sugar is a small store that shares its space with Chunky Boss. Inside the store there are only few stools to sit and dine. The menu has most of the popular TS drinks including the famous brown sugar tea. We ordered multiple drinks. It was prepared within a short time. Quick and friendly service. Loved the taste of their drinks.

This is the first I was in a TS store that had bakery items. I got a couple of egg tars and puffs. Both items were amazing quality. Egg tars had such delicious yolk. The puff had tasty cream in the middle. I was so impressed with their bakery goods.",0
2,"Tiger Sugar with a bakery section and hot fried chicken (they were out of salt pepper chicken, though). Bubble tea was ok, though the tea was very bitter at 50% sugar one time, and the next time was good, so rather inconsistent? Puffs were good, filled when you order them.

Fried chicken cutlet was good, but there was a large wishbone or similar on one side, had to spit out what I was eating and ended up almost piercing my tongue with a piece of shattered chicken bone. Not good.

Service on the slower end, so have patience.",0
5,"The Tiger Sugar branch with most items I think. The girl who works today is super super nice, with such an angel voice! She asked be a lot of thoughtful questions. This is not my first time come to boba shop, but this one gives me good impression that makes me want to come back againüòÜ!

I ordered the classic combo, which is the number one. I also ordered the eclair and puffs. They are not as sweet as I thought, which is wonderful, instead, it‚Äôs a bit creamy. Very nice! I also ordered on more #7, which is what I always order. It‚Äôs sooo good!",0
5,"I tried Tiger Sugar's new pastries, and they were really fresh and crispy. I especially liked the strawberry egg tart and croissants, though the croissants were quite small‚Äîthey looked more like mini croissants. I‚Äôd recommend going for the egg tarts and cream puffs instead. The place is on the smaller side, but the brown sugar boba was as good as always!",0
1,"This specific drink is so bitter when I was drinking it which is so different from the ones that I had when I was in Brooklyn. In addition, you can see there‚Äôs some sort of unknown substances in there. And I had a upset stomach.",0
4,"Stopped into this shop and ordered two boba teas,  the Brave As A Tiger, and the Passion Friuty Green Tea with Boba & Jelly. They were both delicious! üòã
Just remember to shake up your drink before putting your straw in and drinking!!

We didn't order any food,  just the teas. The prices are reasonable at $7 for a medium.",0

5,"Delicious pastries. Egg tart is amazing and the cream puffs ‚Ä¶ we tried the chocolate and the vanilla ‚Ä¶ going back for more and to try strawberry!  Crispy shells, rich fillings - must try!",0
5,They didn‚Äôt have only bubble tea they also come with more option like deep fried chickens or cream puff,0
5,"The number1 signature on the menu was really nice and tasty.. the staff was very friendly and accomodating too

One of the best taiwanese boba tea i had so far",0
4,"This tiger sugar is consistent with all the ones I have been too.  This location also serves chunky boss.

If you want bubble tea then you can use the self ordering kiosk by the windows. You don't have to go inside.  Go inside if you want to order both products.

There is seating inside but with how small it is , the space gets cluttered up with people waiting for their orders.",0
5,"We were staying in the club quarters hotel  It's in front of our  hotel, I ordered the tiger sugar and signature eclair, then I bought black sugar milk egg roll it was  buy 1 get 1 free, omg It‚Äôs so yummy I wish I can buy more. Please can you help me where I can order online and ship to me here in NC I need 3 -4 dozen  of black sugar milk egg roll please",0
2,"I ordered the chicken cutlet with fries .
Pros: The fries were really good , perfectly fired with a good crunch .
Cons: (personally) The chicken cutlet was entirely too sweet and the breading was soggy. Not exactly what I was expecting.",0
5,"My employer and I decided to visit 45th street during our eventful break. I saw Tiger Sugar and decided to try out its food and bubble tea. After ordering, I enjoyed the Plum Sweet Potato Fries. Based on the strong aroma of the side order of fries, my gut knew that I am eating food made from natural, starch ingredients with a hint of sugar. I also ordered Taro Bubble Tea.",0
1,"Don‚Äôt order their mango pomelo/sago, it tastes like the mixture of chemical and plastic. I am not sure if it‚Äôs because the bad quality of cup or straw so that I even poured it out in a glass cup, it still tasted the same. Not gonna lie, the tasting of that drink is really disgusting, and I even tips them.",0
4,I love the brown sugar bubble tea! Unfortunately the latest strawberry crush is NOT it. Tastes yogurty which doesn't mesh well with the brown sugar,0
5,"In addition to its milk tea, the bread from Tiger Sugar is also extremely delicious. It's a brand that puts a lot of effort into making its products.",0
4,"We had the brown sugar milk, it was tasty with little pearls (i think it was sago?) and black tapioca pearls.",0
5,"I think I had heard of Tiger Sugar before, but I never really tried it. So after discovering the Midtown Comics that is right next door, I decided to give this place a try as a semi-regular bubble tea enthusiast.

This Tiger Sugar near Grand Central appears to be a brand new location as there is a grand opening sign that advertises a special offer outside. The whole menu and their specialty seems to be brown sugar boba milk tea made with fresh milk, as well as other options having slight variations such as different toppings. For example, I ordered number 10, which is a brown sugar boba tea with chocolate chips and cream mousse.

Maybe it was because I was the only customer there when I arrived, but my drink arrived literally seconds after I paid for my order. Cashier seemed as chill as the tea itself, which for my first time at this boba venue was pretty decent. All the drinks cost at least $6.25 though, so if you're already a fan of boba and are wary with your funds, your mileage may vary. You can't use your credit card unless you spend at least $10, so I recommend buying some tea for a friend as well if you don't have cash on hand.

Hope this new area does well, tea was nice enough to maybe consider coming again if I happen to be in the area.",0
5,"2/2024: As good as any other tiger sugar out there, and they‚Äôre good. $6.50 for a drink. Nice chewy boba milk tea here.",1
1,"First and last time. The gentleman working here needs a customer service lesson. He was too busy rushing us because he needed to fulfill the door dash orders. News flash my friend, the customers coming into the store takes first priority. Will not return. Gong Cha treats ppl better and they listen to the customer.",0
4,"Nice location. If you google map it, it will show a picture of CoCo, but it‚Äôs actually Tiger Sugar. Small place inside and there is seating. It‚Äôs about $7 a drink after tax. Self order and pay at kiosk.",0
5,Tiger sugar has the best bubble tea! The brown sugar and cream is to die for. Always velvety and delicious.,0
2,"A few years ago when this chain was trendy their signature black sugar tea was incredible.

First time trying it in a few years and everything that was right before is wrong now. Taste and texture were bland. Boba was good but they use a blend with mini boba I don‚Äôt care for.",0
5,"Love the classic milk tea! The hot option in the winter is super nice, it's one of my favourite things to warm up with!",0
5,"Excellent service. Fastest bubble tea making I've seen in some time, and extremely friendly service.",0
4,"Service was pretty quick ( there's a flipside to that), the place was clean and the customer section was small w/ 2 chairs/stools and a counter that runs along the wall. There's a huge chicken nugget on the wall opposite the entrance.

I bought the brown sugar Boba tea w/ pudding and boba. Tastes great, no complaints. Was my first time getting milk tea with milk pudding so I'm glad it was good. The milk tea added texture- soft and smooth whereas the boba is soft and gummy- more than anything else.

My friend bought the taro milk tea w/ pudding- and it was bad. She tried to like it. I tried to like it (and Taro milk tea is both of our favorite drinks to get w/ boba). It just wasn't good. The pudding was fine I guess, it was just seemed to be the only Taro thing about the drink. The tea itself was light tan and opaque/milky. It needed flavor and sugar, and even the tasty boba couldn't help it. The worst thing was that there was something grainy in the drink. At first I assumed it was simply large granules of sugar, but then I actually came across those. Then I guessed it must've been undissolved Taro powder or something, which didn't help regardless. Having worked in a store that mostly slings beverages I totally understand the need for speed, but not at the cost of quality. I noticed they may have been getting mobile orders and only saw one guy making drinks so maybe he was feeling the pressure, but making sure any ingredient that can be dissolved is 90-100% dissolved can really improve the customer experience, especially when the drinking experience is just as based on texture as flavor.

We would've gone back to swap the drink, but like I said- she tried to like it and give it a shot, and we were heading to an appointment.

Overall I would go back, I'd just never get a Taro tea here again.",0
1,"When we got our drinks, we asked if they could put some milk in it. To which they rudely said not to. After we kindly asked for a refund or if we could just change our drink they said no  throw it away. Not only did we have a bad experience the boba was not even good. That is why this place get 1/5 stars",0
5,"I absolutely love this store, perfect location, the staff was extremely nice and the drink I picked out was amazing! Love the way they make their tapioca, they‚Äôre huge, super soft and chewy with a great flavor! I‚Äôm not going to give less than 5 stars because of the service and quality but my only tiny issue is that there‚Äôs a $10 minimum purchase with a card. If they could fix this tiny issue I‚Äôd be the happiest. I‚Äôll be returning almost daily for sure!",0
1,Absolute worst boba I‚Äôve ever tasted. Ordered the brown sugar and it was a straight up thick cup of cream with mushy boba that all gooped together. Also got a matcha tea boba which was better but still not great. Would not recommend. Couldn‚Äôt take more than a few sips of the brown sugar before I had to throw it away. If you‚Äôre lactose intolerant be warned,0
5,"Excellent customer service, the staff was welcoming and super friendly! They didn‚Äôt rush me, allowed me to take my time to decide my order. The boba and chicken were delicious!",0
5,Chocolate boba + pearl + jelly less sweet. What a perfect combination.,1

4,"First time at this spot for the Chunky Boss (Chicken) and it was everything they advertised and more. The chicken alone was hung and enough for a meal on its own, It was savory with a slight sweat underline heat but not spicy.... I got the original.

5,"I ordered a glass of milk and a piece of fried chicken. After getting the Zhen milk, I took a sip (mm...). The perfect combination of QQ pearls and milk made the Zhen milk extremely delicious. The fried chicken is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside plus hot and sour powder, making the fried chicken rich in layers. Very delicious!
